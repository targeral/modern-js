section describes some of the core methods provided by Builder.\n\n\ncreateBuilder#\n\nCreate a Builder instance object.\n\nWhen using this method, it needs to be used with the\n@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider or @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider.\nProviders implements corresponding build feature based on specific bundlers.\n\n\nbuilderWebpackProvider#\n\nWhen builderWebpackProvider is passed, the Builder will use webpack as the\nbundler for building.\n\n\n\n\nconst provider = builderWebpackProvider({\n  builderConfig: {\n    // some configs\n  },\n});\n\nconst builder = await createBuilder(provider, {\n  // some options\n});\n\n\n\nbuilderRspackProvider#\n\nWhen builderRspackProvider is passed, the Builder will use Rspack as the bundler\nfor building.\n\n\n\n\nconst provider = builderRspackProvider({\n  builderConfig: {\n    // some configs\n  },\n});\n\nconst builder = await createBuilder(provider, {\n  // some options\n});\n\n\n\noptions#\n\nThe second parameter of createBuilder is a options object, you can pass in the\nfollowing options:\n\ntype BuilderEntry = Record;\n\ntype BuilderTarget = 'web' | 'node' | 'modern-web' | 'web-worker';\n\ntype CreateBuilderOptions = {\n  cwd?: string;\n  entry?: BuilderEntry;\n  target?: BuilderTarget | BuilderTarget[];\n  framework?: string;\n  configPath?: string | null;\n};\n\n\nDescription:\n\n * cwd: The root path of the current build, the default value is process.cwd().\n * entry: Build entry object.\n * target: Build target type, the default value is ['web'], see chapter Build\n   Target for details.\n * framework: The name of the framework, a unique identifier, the default value\n   is 'modern.js'.\n * configPath: The path to the framework config file (absolute path), this\n   parameter affects the build cache update.\n\n\nmergeBuilderConfig#\n\nMerges multiple Builder config objects and returns a new merged object.\n\n * Type\n\nfunction mergeBuilderConfig(...configs: BuilderConfig[]): BuilderConfig;\n\n\n * Example\n\n\n\nconst config1 = {\n  dev: {\n    https: false,\n  },\n};\nconst config2 = {\n  dev: {\n    https: true,\n  },\n};\n\nconst mergedConfig = mergeBuilderConfig(config1, config2);\n\nconsole.log(mergedConfig); // { dev: { https: true } }\n\n\n> This method does not modify the original config object.\n\n\nwebpack#\n\nA webpack object for consuming webpack builtin plugins or type definitions.\n\n * Example\n\n\n\nnew webpack.DefinePlugin();\n\n\n> In most scenarios, it is recommended to import webpack from Builder instead of\n> manually installing a \"webpack\" dependency, which can avoid multi-instance\n> problems.\n\n\nHtmlWebpackPlugin#\n\nHtmlWebpackPlugin object, usually used to implement custom plugins of\nHtmlWebpackPlugin.\n\n * Example\n\n\n\n\n> In most scenarios, it is recommended to import HtmlWebpackPlugin from builder\n> instead of manually installing a \"html-webpack-plugin\" dependency, which can\n> avoid multi-instance problems.","frontmatter":{"extractApiHeaders":[2]},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/api/builder-core.mdx","_relativePath":"en/api/builder-core.mdx"},{"id":1,"title":"Builder

development build, you can set the mode option to\n'development'.\n\nawait builder.build({\n  mode: 'development',\n});\n\n\n\nMonitor file changes#\n\nIf you need to watch file changes and re-build, you can set the watch option to\ntrue.\n\nawait builder.build({\n  watch: true,\n});\n\n\n\nCustom Compiler#\n\nIn some cases, you may want to use a custom compiler:\n\nconst compiler = webpack({\n

The plugin object contains the following\nproperties:\n\n * name: The name of the plugin, a unique identifier.\n * setup: The setup function of the plugin, which can be an asynchronous\n   function. This function will only be executed once when the plugin is\n   initialized.\n * pre：Specify which plugins precede the current plugin, and the current plugin\n   will be adjusted to execute after these plugins.\n * post：Specify which post-plugins are available for the current plugin, and the\n   current plugin will be adjusted to execute before these plugins.\n\nexport type BuilderPlugin = {\n  name: string;\n  pre?: string[];\n  post?: string[];\n  setup: (api: API) => Promise | void;\n};\n\n\nYou can import this type from @modern-js/builder:\n\n\n\nexport default (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-plugin-foo',\n\n  pre: ['builder-plugin-bar'],\n\n  setup: api => {\n    api.onAfterBuild(() => {\n      console.log('after build!');\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nBuilderPluginAPI#\n\nThe type of plugin API. The plugin API provides the context info, utility\nfunctions and lifecycle hooks.\n\nFor a complete introduction to lifecycle hooks, please read the Plugin Hooks\nchapter.\n\nWhen using webpack-provider or rspack-provider, the type definition of\nBuilderPluginAPI is somewhat different, and you can introduce the corresponding\ntype according to the usage scenario of the plugin.\n\n\nPlugin for webpack-provider#\n\nWhen developing plugins for webpack-provider, please import BuilderPluginAPI\nfrom @modern-js/builder-webpack-provider.\n\n\n\n\nexport default (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-plugin-foo',\n\n  setup: api => {\n    api.modifyWebpackConfig(config => {\n      config.devtool = false;\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nPlugins for rspack-provider#\n\nWhen developing plugins for rspack-provider, please import BuilderPluginAPI from\n@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider.\n\n\n\n\nexport default (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-plugin-foo',\n\n  setup: api => {\n    api.modifyRspackConfig(config => {\n      config.devtool = false;\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nPlugins for both webpack-provider and rspack-provider#\n\nWhen developing plugins for both webpack-provider and rspack-provider, please\nimport DefaultBuilderPlugin from @modern-js/builder-shared.\n\nNote that developing plugins that can support both webpack and Rspack at the\nsame time means that you cannot use any APIs with webpack / Rspack identifiers,\nsuch as modifyWebpackConfig or modifyRspackConfig.\n\nYou can use modifyBundlerChain to modify the configuration that applies to both\nwebpack and Rspack.\n\n\n\n\nexport default (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-plugin-foo',\n\n  setup: api => {\n    api.modifyBundlerChain(chain => {\n      chain.devtool(false);\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\n\napi.context#\n\napi.context is a read-only object that provides some context information.\n\nThe content of api.context is exactly the same as builder.context, please refer\nto builder.context.\n\n * Example\n\nconst builderPluginFoo = () => ({\n   setup(api) {\n     console.log(api.context.distPath);\n   }\n);\n\n\n\napi.getBuilderConfig#\n\n * Example\n\nconst builderPluginFoo = () => ({\n   setup(api) {\n     const config = api.getBuilderConfig();\n     console.log(config.html?.title);\n   }\n);\n\n\n\napi.getNormalizedConfig#\n\n * Example\n\nconst builderPluginFoo = () => ({\n   setup(api) {\n     const config = api.getNormalizedConfig();\n     console.log(config.html.title);\n   }\n);\n\n\n\napi.isPluginExists#\n\n * Example\n\nexport default () => ({\n  setup: api => {\n    console.log(api.isPluginExists('builder-plugin-foo'));\n  },\n});\n\n\n\napi.getHTMLPaths#\n\n * Example\n\nconst builderPluginFoo = () => ({\n   setup(api) {\n     api.modifyWebpackChain(() => {\n       const htmlPaths = api.getHTMLPaths();\n       console.log(htmlPaths);

You can use this hook when using webpack-provider or\nrspack-provider.\n\nThis hook only supports modifying the configuration of the non-differentiated\nparts of webpack and Rspack.

This can be useful when you want to use a short, easy-to-remember name for\na module instead of a long, complex path.\n\nFor example, if you have a file at src/common/request.ts, you could create an\nalias called @request for it, so you could `.

We recommend to use this way in TypeScript projects, because it\ncan solve type problem of alias path.\n\nFor example:\n\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@common/*\": [\"./src/common/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\n\nPriority\n\nThe paths config has higher priority than source.alias.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/advanced/alias.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/advanced/alias.md"},{"id":15,"title":"Browser Compatibility","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/advanced/browser-compatibility","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Set browserslist","id":"set-browserslist","depth":2,"charIndex":119},{"text":"Background knowledge","id":"background-knowledge","depth":2,"charIndex":826},{"text":"Syntax downgrade and API downgrade","id":"syntax-downgrade-and-api-downgrade","depth":3,"charIndex":999},{"text":"Syntax transpilation","id":"syntax-transpilation","depth":3,"charIndex":1742},{"text":"API Polyfill","id":"api-polyfill","depth":3,"charIndex":4176},{"text":"Downgrade method","id":"downgrade-method","depth":2,"charIndex":6084},{"text":"Downgrade the current project code","id":"downgrade-the-current-project-code","depth":3,"charIndex":6928},{"text":"Downgrade third-party dependencies","id":"downgrade-third-party-dependencies","depth":3,"charIndex":7136},{"text":"Downgrade the code out of the current project","id":"downgrade-the-code-out-of-the-current-project","depth":3,"charIndex":7598},{"text":"Polyfill mode","id":"polyfill-mode","depth":2,"charIndex":8414},{"text":"entry mode","id":"entry-mode","depth":3,"charIndex":8723},{"text":"usage mode","id":"usage-mode","depth":3,"charIndex":9342},{"text":"Disable Polyfill","id":"disable-polyfill","depth":3,"charIndex":10349}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nThis chapter introduces how to use the capabilities provided by Builder to deal\nwith browser compatibility issues.\n\n\nSet browserslist#\n\nBefore dealing with compatibility issues, you first need to clarify which\nbrowsers your project needs to support, and add the corresponding browserslist\nconfig.\n\n * If you haven't set browserslist yet, please read the Browserslist chapter\n   first.\n\n * If you have set a browserslist, Builder will automatically compile according\n   to that scope, downgrade JavaScript syntax and CSS syntax, and inject the\n   required polyfill. In most cases, you can safely use modern ECMAScript\n   features without worrying about compatibility issues.\n\nAfter setting the browserslist, if you still encountered some compatibility\nissues, please continue reading below contents to find some solutions.\n\n\nBackground knowledge#\n\nBefore dealing with compatibility issues, it is recommended that you understand\nthe following background knowledge to better handle related issues.\n\n\nSyntax downgrade and API downgrade#\n\nWhen you use higher-version syntax and API in your project, in order to make the\ncompiled code run stably in lower-version browsers, we need to downgrade two\nparts: syntax downgrade and API downgrade.\n\nBuilder downgrades syntax through syntax transpilation, and downgrades API\nthrough inject polyfill.\n\n> Grammar and API are not strongly bound. When browser manufacturers implement\n> the engine, they will support some syntax or implement some APIs in advance\n> according to the specification or their own needs. Therefore, browsers from\n> different manufacturers in the same period are not necessarily compatible with\n> syntax and API. So in general practice, syntax and API are handled in two\n> parts.\n\n\nSyntax transpilation#\n\nSyntax is a series of rules for how a programming language organizes code, and\ncode that does not follow these rules cannot be correctly recognized by the\nprogramming language's engine and therefore cannot be run. In JavaScript, the\nfollowing examples are syntax rules:\n\n * In const foo = 1, const means to declare an immutable constant.\n * In foo?.bar?.baz, ?. indicates optional chaining of access properties.\n * In async function () {}, async means to declare an asynchronous function.\n\nBecause the parsers of different browsers can support different syntax,\nespecially the old version of the browser engine can support less grammar, so\nwhen some syntax are run in the lower version of the browser engine, an error\nwill be reported at the stage of parsing the AST .\n\nFor example, the following code will report an error in IE browser or a lower\nversion of Node.js:\n\nconst foo = {};\nfoo?.bar();\n\n\nWhen we run this code in a low version of Node.js, the following error message\nwill appear:\n\nSyntaxError: Unexpected token.\n   at Object.exports.runInThisContext (vm.js:73:16)\n   at Object. ([eval]-wrapper:6:22)\n   at Module._compile (module.js:460:26)\n   at evalScript (node.js:431:25)\n   at startup (node.js:90:7)\n   at node.js:814:3\n\n\nIt is obvious from the error message that this is a syntax error. This means\nthat this syntax is not supported in lower versions of the engine.\n\nSyntax can not be supported by polyfill or shim. If you want to run some syntax\nthat it does not originally support in a low-version browser, you need to\ntranspile the code into a syntax that the low-version engine can support.\n\nTranspile the above code into the following code to run in lower version\nengines:\n\nvar foo = {};\nfoo === null || foo === void 0 ? void 0 : foo.bar();\n\n\nAfter transpilation, the syntax of the code has changed, and some syntax that\nthe engine of the lower version cannot understand has been replaced with the\nsyntax it can understand, but the meaning of the code itself has not changed.\n\nIf the engine encounters an unrecognized syntax when converting to AST, it will\nreport a syntax error and abort the code execution process. In this case, if\nyour project does not use capabilities such as SSR or SSG, the page will be\nblank, making the page unavailable.\n\nIf the code is successfully converted to AST, the engine will convert the AST\ninto executable code and execute it normally inside the engine.\n\n\nAPI Polyfill#\n\nJavaScript is an interpreted scripting language, unlike compiled languages like\nRust. Rust will check the calls in the code during the compilation phase, and\nJavaScript does not know whether the function called by this line of code exists\nbefore it actually runs to a certain line of code, so some errors will only\nappear at runtime.\n\nFor example:\n\nvar str = 'Hello world!';\nconsole.log(str.notExistedMethod());\n\n\nThe above code has correct syntax and can be converted to AST correctly in the\nfirst stage of the engine runtime, but when it is actually running, because the\nmethod notExistedMethod does not exist on String.prototype, an error will be\nreported:\n\nUncaught TypeError: str.notExistedMethod is not a function\n   at :2:17\n\n\nWith the iteration of ECMAScript, some new methods will be added to be built-in\nobjects. For example, String.prototype.replaceAll was introduced in ES2021, then\nthe replaceAll method does not exist in the built-in object String.prototype of\nmost browser engines before 2021, so the following code works in the latest\nChrome, but not in earlier versions:\n\n'abc'.replaceAll('abc', 'xyz');\n\n\nIn order to solve the problem that String.prototype lacks replaceAll in older\nbrowsers, we can extend the String.prototype object in older browsers and add\nthe replaceAll method to it, for example:\n\n// The implementation of this polyfill does not necessarily conform to the standard, it is only used as an example.\nif (!String.prototype.replaceAll) {\n  String.prototype.replaceAll = function (str, newStr) {\n    // If a regex pattern\n    if (\n      Object.prototype.toString.call(str).toLowerCase() === '[object regexp]'\n    ) {\n      return this.replace(str, newStr);\n    }\n    // If a string\n    return this.replace(new RegExp(str, 'g'), newStr);\n  };\n}\n\n\n> This technique of providing implementations for legacy environments to align\n> new APIs is called polyfill.\n\n\nDowngrade method#\n\nIn Builder, we divide code into three categories:\n\n * The first category is the source code in the current project.\n * The second category is third-party dependencies installed through npm.\n * The third category is the code out of the current project, such as the code\n   in other directories in the monorepo.\n\nBy default, Builder will only compile and downgrade the first category, other\ncategories will not be downgraded by default.\n\nThere are several considerations for this approach:\n\n * Downgrading all third-party party dependencies will significantly reduce\n   build performance.\n * Most third-party dependencies have been downgraded before release, and the\n   second downgrade may introduce new problems.\n * The code out of the current project may have been compiled, or the\n   compilation config may be different.\n\n\nDowngrade the current project code#\n\nThe code of the current project will be downgraded by default, so you don't need\nto add additional config, just make sure that the browserslist config is set\ncorrectly.\n\n\nDowngrade third-party dependencies#\n\nWhen you find that a third-party dependencies causes compatibility issues, you\ncan add this dependency to Builder's source.include config, Make Builder do\nextra compilation for this dependency.\n\nTaking the npm package query-string as an example, you can add the following\nconfig:\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    include: [/\\/query-string\\//],\n  },\n};\n\n\nPlease refer to source.include document for detailed usage guide.\n\n\nDowngrade the code out of the current project#\n\nWhen you import the code out of the current project, if the code has not been\ncompiled, then you also need to configure source.include to it to compile.\n\nFor example, if you need to reference a module under the packages directory in\nthe monorepo, you can add the following config:\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    include: [\n      // method one:\n      // Compile all files in the package directory of Monorepo\n      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../packages'),\n\n      // Method Two:\n      // Compile the source code of a package in the Monorepo's package directory\n      // The matching range of this writing method is more precise, and has less impact on the overall compilation performance\n      path.resolve(__dirname, '../../packages/xxx/src'),\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nPolyfill mode#\n\nBuilder compiles JavaScript code through babel or SWC, and injects polyfill\nlibraries like core-js, @babel/runtime and @swc/helpers.\n\nIn different usage scenarios, you may need different polyfill solutions. Builder\nprovides output.polyfill config to switch between different polyfill modes.\n\n\nentry mode#\n\nentry is the default mode and does not need to be set manually.\n\nWhen using the entry mode, Builder will analyze which core-js methods need to be\ninjected according to the browserslist set by the current project, and inject\nthem to the entry file of each page. The polyfill injected in this way is more\ncomprehensive, and there is no need to worry about the project source code and\nthird-party dependencies polyfill issues. However, because some unused polyfill\ncodes are included, the bundle size may increase.\n\nThe config of entry mode is:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    polyfill: 'entry',\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nusage mode#\n\nThe usage mode allows more precise control over which core-js polyfills need to\nbe injected.\n\nWhen you enable the usage mode, Builder will analyze the source code in the\nproject and determine which polyfills need to be injected.\n\nFor example, the code uses the Map object:\n\nvar b = new Map();\n\n\nAfter compilation, only the polyfills for Map will be injected into this file:\n\nimport 'core-js/modules/es.map';\nvar b = new Map();\n\n\nThe advantage of this method is that the size of the injected polyfill is\nsmaller, which is suitable for projects with higher requirements on bundle size.\nThe disadvantage is that polyfill may not be fully injected, because third-party\ndependencies will not be compiled and downgraded by default, so the polyfill\nrequired by third-party dependencies will not be analyzed. If you need to\nanalyze a third-party dependency, you also need to add it to source.include\nconfig.\n\nThe config of usage mode is:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    polyfill: 'usage',\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nDisable Polyfill#\n\nYou can disable polyfill injection behavior by setting output.polyfill to 'off'.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    polyfill: 'off',\n  },\n};\n\n\nWhen using this config, you need to ensure compatibility by yourself, such as\nmanually import the required polyfill code through source.preEntry.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/advanced/browser-compatibility.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/advanced/browser-compatibility.md"},{"id":16,"title":"Browserslist","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/advanced/browserslist","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"What is Browserslist","id":"what-is-browserslist","depth":2,"charIndex":111},{"text":"Set Browserslist","id":"set-browserslist","depth":2,"charIndex":1740},{"text":"Example","id":"example","depth":3,"charIndex":1886},{"text":"Effective Scope","id":"effective-scope","depth":3,"charIndex":2156},{"text":"Use output.overrideBrowserslist config","id":"use-outputoverridebrowserslist-config","depth":3,"charIndex":2598},{"text":"Commonly used Browserslist","id":"commonly-used-browserslist","depth":2,"charIndex":3983},{"text":"Mobile H5 scene","id":"mobile-h5-scene","depth":3,"charIndex":4112},{"text":"Desktop PC scene","id":"desktop-pc-scene","depth":3,"charIndex":4714},{"text":"Default Browserslist","id":"default-browserslist","depth":2,"charIndex":5264},{"text":"Web Target","id":"web-target","depth":3,"charIndex":5509},{"text":"Node Target","id":"node-target","depth":3,"charIndex":5683},{"text":"Web Worker Target","id":"web-worker-target","depth":3,"charIndex":5773},{"text":"Modern Web Target","id":"modern-web-target","depth":3,"charIndex":5915},{"text":"Query browser support","id":"query-browser-support","depth":2,"charIndex":6098}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports using Browserslist to specify which browsers should be\nsupported in your Web application.\n\n\nWhat is Browserslist#\n\nSince different browsers support ECMAScript and CSS differently, developers need\nto set the correct browser range for web applications.\n\nBrowserslist can specify which browsers your web application can run in, it\nprovides a configuration for specifying browsers range. Browserslist has become\na standard in the industry, it is used by libraries such as Autoprefixer, Babel,\nESLint, PostCSS, SWC and Webpack.\n\nWhen you specify a browser range through Browserslist, Builder will compile\nJavaScript and CSS code to the specified syntax, and inject the corresponding\npolyfill code. When you only need to be compatible with modern browsers, the\ncompilation process will introduce less compatible code and polyfills, and the\nperformance of the page will be better.\n\nFor example, when you need to be compatible with IE11 browser, Builder will\ncompile the code to ES5 and inject the polyfill required by IE11 through\ncore-js.\n\nWhat is polyfill\n\nA polyfill is a piece of code that provides the functionality of a newer feature\nto older browsers that do not support that feature natively. It is used to fill\nin the gaps in older browsers' implementations of web standards, allowing\ndevelopers to use newer features safely without having to worry about whether or\nnot they will work in older browsers. For example, if a browser does not support\nthe Array.map() method, a polyfill can be used to provide that functionality,\nallowing code that uses Array.prototype.flat() to work in that browser.\nPolyfills are commonly used to ensure that web applications can work on a wide\nrange of browsers, including older ones.\n\n\nSet Browserslist#\n\nYou can set the Browserslist value in the package.json or .browserslistrc file\nin the root directory of the current project.\n\n\nExample#\n\nSet via browserslist in package.json:\n\n{\n  \"browserslist\": [\n    \"iOS >= 9\",\n    \"Android >= 4.4\",\n    \"last 2 versions\",\n    \"> 0.2%\",\n    \"not dead\"\n  ]\n}\n\n\nSet via a separate .browserslistrc file:\n\niOS >= 9\nAndroid >= 4.4\nlast 2 versions\n> 0.2%\nnot dead\n\n\n\nEffective Scope#\n\nBy default, the .browserslistrc file only takes effect for browser-side bundles,\nincluding the web and web-worker target types.\n\nWhen you are building multiple targets at the same time, for example if the\ntargets contains both web and node, only the web bundles will be affected by the\n.browserslistrc file. If you want to make changes to the node bundles, you can\nuse the output.overrideBrowserslist configuration below.\n\n\nUse output.overrideBrowserslist config#\n\nIn addition to the above standard usage, Builder also provides\noutput.overrideBrowserslist config, which can also set the value of\nBrowserslist.\n\noverrideBrowserslist can be set to an array, which is written in the same way as\nthe browserslistrc configuration, but has a higher priority than browserslistrc.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    overrideBrowserslist: [\n      'iOS >= 9',\n      'Android >= 4.4',\n      'last 2 versions',\n      '> 0.2%',\n      'not dead',\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\n\nWhen .overrideBrowserslist is set to an array, it will also only work for\nbrowser-side bundles.\n\nWhen you build multiple targets at the same time, you can set different browser\nranges for different targets. At this point, you need to set\noverrideBrowserslist to an object whose key is the corresponding build target.\n\nFor example to set different ranges for web and node:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    overrideBrowserslist: {\n      web: [\n        'iOS >= 9',\n        'Android >= 4.4',\n        'last 2 versions',\n        '> 0.2%',\n        'not dead',\n      ],\n      node: ['node >= 14'],\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nIn most cases, it is recommended to use the .browserslistrc file rather than the\noverrideBrowserslist config. Because the .browserslistrc file is the official\nconfig file, it is more general and can be recognized by other libraries in the\ncommunity.\n\n\nCommonly used Browserslist#\n\nThe following are some commonly used Browserslist, you can choose according to\nyour project type.\n\n\nMobile H5 scene#\n\nThe mobile H5 scene is mainly compatible with iOS and Android systems, usually\nwe set Browserslist as:\n\niOS >= 9\nAndroid >= 4.4\nlast 2 versions\n> 0.2%\nnot dead\n\n\nThe above Browserslist will compile the code to the ES5 specification, which is\ncompatible with most mobile scenarios on the market. For the detailed browsers\nlist, please check browserslist.dev.\n\n\n\nYou can also choose to use the ES6 specification in the H5 scene, which will\nmake the performance of the page better.

But if you need to modify the built-in webpack plugins or\nloaders of Builder, please use tools.webpackChain to modify.\n\n\nUsing webpack-chain#\n\nwebpack-chain is a configuration modification tools that is different from\nmodifying webpack configuration objects. Compared with modifying webpack\nconfiguration objects, webpack-chain not only supports chain calls, but also can\nmodify built-in Rule or Plugin based on id.\n\n\ntools.webpackChain config#\n\nBuilder provides tools.webpackChain config to modify webpack-chain.\n\nThe value of tools.webpackChain is Function type, which receives two parameters:\n\n * The first parameter is the webpack-chain instance, you can use this instance\n   to modify the default webpack config.\n * The second parameter is a utils collection, including env, isProd, CHAIN_ID,\n   etc.\n\nHere's a basic example:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain: (chain, { env }) => {\n      if (env === 'development') {\n        chain.devtool('cheap-module-eval-source-map');\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nwebpack-chain Basics#\n\nBefore you start using webpack-chain to modify your webpack configuration, it is\nrecommended that you understand some basics.\n\n\nHow does webpack-chain locate#\n\nSimply put, webpack-chain requires users to set a unique id for each Rule,\nLoader, Plugin, and Minimizer. Through these ids, you can easily find the\ndesired object from deeply nested webpack configuration object.\n\nBuilder exports all internally defined ids through the CHAIN_ID object, so you\ncan use these exported ids to locate the Loader or Plugin you want to modify,\nwithout having to search through complex traversal in the webpack configuration\nobject.\n\nFor example, to delete the built-in HTML plugin via CHAIN_ID.PLUGIN.HTML:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain: (chain, { webpack, CHAIN_ID }) => {\n      //\n      chain.plugins.delete(CHAIN_ID.PLUGIN.HTML);\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nwebpack-chain id type#\n\nThe CHAIN_ID object contains some ids, which have different meanings:\n\nCHAIN_ID FIELD            CORRESPONDING CONFIGURATION   DESCRIPTION\nCHAIN_ID.PLUGIN           plugins[i]                    corresponds to a plugin in the webpack configuration\nCHAIN_ID.RULE             module.rules[i]               corresponds to a Rule in the webpack configuration\nCHAIN_ID.USE              module.rules[i].loader        corresponds to a Loader in the webpack configuration\nCHAIN_ID.MINIMIZER        optimization.minimizer        corresponds to a compression tool in webpack configuration\nCHAIN_ID.RESOLVE_PLUGIN   resolve.plugins[i]            corresponds to a Resolve plugin in the webpack configuration\n\n\nwebpack-chain Demo#\n\n\nAdd/Modify/Delete loader#\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain: (chain, { CHAIN_ID }) => {\n      // Add loader\n      chain.module\n        .rule('md')\n        .test(/\\.md$/)\n        .use('md-loader')\n        .loader('md-loader');\n\n      // Modify loader\n      chain.module\n        .rule(CHAIN_ID.RULE.JS)\n        .use(CHAIN_ID.USE.BABEL)\n        .tap(options => {\n          options.plugins.push('babel-plugin-xxx');\n          return options;\n        });\n\n      // Delete loader\n      chain.module.rule(CHAIN_ID.RULE.JS).uses.delete(CHAIN_ID.USE.BABEL);\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nAdd/Modify/Delete plugin#\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain: (chain, { webpack, CHAIN_ID }) => {\n      // Add plugin\n      chain.plugin('custom-define').use(webpack.DefinePlugin, [\n        {\n          'process.env': {\n            NODE_ENV: JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),\n          },\n        },\n      ]);\n\n      // Modify plugin\n      chain.plugin(CHAIN_ID.PLUGIN.HMR).tap(options => {\n        options[0].fullBuildTimeout = 200;\n        return options;\n      });\n\n      // Delete plugin\n      chain.plugins.delete(CHAIN_ID.PLUGIN.HMR);\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nModify the config according to environment#\n\nIn the tool collection, you can get the flag of various environments, such as\ndevelopment/production/test environment, SSR build, and Web Worker build, so as\nto modify the config in different environments.\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain: (chain, { env, isProd, target, isServer, isWebWorker }) => {\n      if (utils.env === 'development' || utils.env === 'test') {\n        // ...\n      }\n      if (utils.isProd) {\n        // ...\n      }\n      if (utils.target === 'node') {\n        // ...\n      }\n      if (utils.isServer) {\n        // ...\n      }\n      if (utils.isWebWorker) {\n        // ...\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe above are some common config examples.

This chapter introduces how to use environment\nvariables.\n\n\nDefault Variables#\n\n\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV#\n\nBy default, Builder will automatically set the process.env.NODE_ENV environment\nvariable to 'development' in development mode and 'production' in production\nmode.\n\nYou can use process.env.NODE_ENV directly in Node.js and in the runtime code.\n\nif (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {\n  console.log('this is a development log');\n}\n\n\nIn the development environment, the above code will be compiled as:\n\nif (true) {\n  console.log('this is a development log');\n}\n\n\nIn the production environment, the above code will be compiled as:\n\nif (false) {\n  console.log('this is a development log');\n}\n\n\nAfter code minification, if (false) { ... } will be recognized as invalid code\nand removed automatically.\n\n\nprocess.env.ASSET_PREFIX#\n\nYou can use process.env.ASSET_PREFIX in the runtime code to access the URL\nprefix of static assets.\n\n * In development, it is equivalent to the value set by dev.assetPrefix.\n * In production, it is equivalent to the value set by output.assetPrefix.\n * Builder will automatically remove the trailing slash from assetPrefix to make\n   string concatenation easier.\n\nFor example, we copy the static/icon.png image to the dist directory through\noutput.copy configuration:\n\nexport default {\n  dev: {\n    assetPrefix: '/',\n  },\n  output: {\n    copy: [{ from: './static', to: 'static' }],\n    assetPrefix: 'https://example.com',\n  },\n};\n\n\nThen we can access the image URL in the runtime code:\n\nconst Image = ;\n\n\nIn the development environment, the above code will be compiled as:\n\nconst Image = ;\n\n\nIn the production environment, the above code will be compiled as:\n\nconst Image = ;\n\n\n\nUsing define config#\n\nBy configuring the source.define, you can replace expressions with other\nexpressions or values in compile time.\n\nDefine looks like macro definitions in other programming languages. But\nJavaScript has powerful runtime capabilities, so you don't need to use it as a\ncomplicated code generator. You can use it to pass simple data, such as\nenvironment variables, from compile time to runtime. Almost there, it can be\nused to work with Builder to shake trees.\n\n\nReplace Expressions#\n\nThe most basic use case for Define is to replace expressions in compile time.\n\nThe value of the environment variable NODE_ENV will change the behavior of many\nvendor packages. Usually, we need to set it to production.\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    define: {\n      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(process.env.NODE_ENV),\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nNote that the value provided here must be a JSON string, e.g.\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV with a value of \"production\" should be passed in as\n\"\\\"production\\\"\" to be processed correctly.\n\nSimilarly { foo: \"bar\" } should be converted to \"{\\\"foo\\\":\\\"bar\\\"}\", which if\npassed directly into the original object would mean replacing the expression\nprocess.env.NODE_ENV.foo with the identifier bar.\n\nFor more about source.define, just refer to API References.\n\nTIP\n\nThe environment variable NODE_ENV shown in the example above is already injected\nby the Builder, and you usually do not need to configure it manually.\n\n\nSetup Environment Variables#\n\nYou may often need to set environment variables, in which case you can instead\nuse the source.globalVars configuration to simplify configuration. It is a\nsyntax sugar of source.define, the only difference is that source.globalVars\nwill automatically stringify the value, which makes it easier to set the value\nof global variables and avoid writing a lot of JSON.stringify(...) stuffs.\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    globalVars: {\n      'process.env.NODE_ENV': 'production',\n      'import.meta.foo': { bar: 42 },\n      'import.meta.baz': false,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nNote that either of these methods will only match the full expression;\ndestructing the expression will prevent the Builder from correctly recognizing\nit.\n\nconsole.log(process.env.NODE_ENV);\n// => production\n\nconst { NODE_ENV } = process.env;\nconsole.log(NODE_ENV);\n// => undefined\n\nconst vars = process.env;\nconsole.log(vars.NODE_ENV);\n// => undefined\n\n\n\nDeclare type of environment variable#\n\nWhen you read an environment variable in a TypeScript file, TypeScript may\nprompt that the variable lacks a type definition, and you need to add the\ncorresponding type declaration.\n\nFor example, if you reference a CUSTOM_VAR variable, the following prompt will\nappear in the TypeScript file:\n\nTS2304: Cannot find name 'CUSTOM_VAR'.\n\n\nTo fix this, you can create a src/env.d.ts file in your project and add the\nfollowing content:\n\nsrc/env.d.ts\n\ndeclare const CUSTOM_VAR: string;\n\n\n\nTree Shaking#\n\nDefine can also be used to mark dead code to assist the Builder with Tree\nShaking optimization.\n\nBuilding products for different regions is achieved by replacing\nprocess.env.REGION with a specific value, for example.\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    define: {\n      'process.env.REGION': JSON.stringify(process.env.REGION),\n    },\n    // or...\n    globalVars: {\n      'process.env.REGION': process.env.REGION,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nFor an internationalized app:\n\nconst App = () => {\n  if (process.env.REGION === 'cn') {\n    return ;\n  } else if (process.env.REGION === 'sg') {\n    return ;\n  } else {\n    return ;\n  }\n};\n\n\nSpecifying the environment variable REGION=sg and then executing build will\neliminate any dead code.\n\nconst App = () => {\n  if (false) {\n  } else if (true) {\n    return ;\n  } else {\n  }\n};\n\n\nUnused components are not packaged into the product, and their external\ndependencies can be optimized accordingly, resulting in a destination with\nbetter size and performance.\n\n\nIn-source testing#\n\nVitest supports writing tests inside source files to test the behavior of\nprivate features without exporting them. Set up Define to remove the test code\nfrom the production build. Please refer to the Vitest's documentation for\ndetailed guidelines\n\n// the implementation\nfunction add(...args) {\n  return args.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);\n}\n\n// in-source test suites\nif (import.meta.vitest) {\n  const { it, expect } = import.meta.vitest;\n  it('add', () => {\n    expect(add()).toBe(0);\n    expect(add(1)).toBe(1);\n    expect(add(1, 2, 3)).toBe(6);\n  });\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/advanced/define.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/advanced/define.md"},{"id":19,"title":"Hot Module Replacement","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/advanced/hmr","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Enabling HMR","id":"enabling-hmr","depth":2,"charIndex":495},{"text":"Specify HMR URL","id":"specify-hmr-url","depth":2,"charIndex":749},{"text":"Default Config","id":"default-config","depth":3,"charIndex":988},{"text":"Proxy","id":"proxy","depth":3,"charIndex":1481},{"text":"Live reloading vs Hot reloading","id":"live-reloading-vs-hot-reloading","depth":2,"charIndex":1845},{"text":"FAQ","id":"faq","depth":2,"charIndex":2529},{"text":"HMR not work when external react/reactDom?","id":"hmr-not-work-when-external-react/reactdom?","depth":3,"charIndex":2536},{"text":"HMR not work when use https?","id":"hmr-not-work-when-use-https?","depth":3,"charIndex":2866},{"text":"React component state lost after HMR?","id":"react-component-state-lost-after-hmr?","depth":3,"charIndex":3333}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nHot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an\napplication is running, without a full reload.

By default, HMR is enabled in development.\n\nBy setting dev.hmr to false, HMR can be disabled, which the HMR and\nreact-refresh will no longer work.\n\nexport default {\n  dev: {\n    hmr: false,\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nSpecify HMR URL#\n\nBy default, Builder uses the host and port number of the current page to splice\nthe WebSocket URL of HMR.\n\nWhen the HMR connection fails, you can specify the WebSocket URL by customizing\ndevServer.client configuration.\n\n\nDefault Config#\n\nThe default config are as follows, Builder will automatically deduce the URL of\nthe WebSocket request according to the current location:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    devServer: {\n      client: {\n        path: '/webpack-hmr',\n        // Equivalent to port of the dev server\n        port: '',\n        // Equivalent to location.hostname\n        host: '',\n        // Equivalent to location.protocol === 'https:' ? 'wss' : 'ws'\n        protocol: '',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nProxy#\n\nIf you are proxying an online page to local development, WebSocket requests will\nfail to connect. You can try configuring devServer.client to the following\nvalues so that HMR requests can reach the local Dev Server.\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    devServer: {\n      client: {\n        host: 'localhost',\n        protocol: 'ws',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nLive reloading vs Hot reloading#\n\n * Live reloading: After modifying the file, webpack recompiles and forces a\n   browser refresh, which is a global (application-wide) refresh, equivalent to\n   window.location.reload().\n * Hot reloading: After modifying the file, webpack recompiles the corresponding\n   module and remembers the state of the application when it is refreshed, thus\n   enabling a partial refresh, i.e. hot update.\n\nDevServer provides two configuration items, hot and liveReload, to control how\nupdates are made. When both hot and liveReload are open, DevServer will attempt\nto use hot mode (HMR) first, and will degrade to reloading the page if the HMR\nupdate fails.\n\n\nFAQ#\n\n\nHMR not work when external react/reactDom?#\n\nHMR work requires the development mode of react & react-dom. The cdn version of\nreact normally used the production mode. You need to switch to development mode\nor make it not external when development.\n\nIf you're not sure which React mode you're using, you can see: Check React Mode\n\n\nHMR not work when use https?#\n\nWhen https is enabled, the HMR perhaps connection fail due to a certificate\nissue, and if you open the console, you will get an HMR connect failed error.\n\n\n\nThe solution to this problem is to click on \"Advanced\" -> \"Proceed to xxx\n(unsafe)\" on the Chrome problem page.\n\n\n\n> Tips: When accessing the page through Localhost, the words \"Your connection is\n> not private\" may not appear and can be handled by visiting the Network domain.\n\n\nReact component state lost after HMR?#\n\nBuilder uses React's official Fast Refresh capability for component hot update.\n\nWhen using Fast Refresh, it is required that the component cannot be an\nanonymous function, otherwise the state of the React component cannot be\npreserved after hot update.\n\nThe following spellings are incorrect:\n\n// wrong spelling 1\nexport default function () {\n  return \nHello World;\n}\n\n// wrong spelling 2\nexport default () => \nHello World;\n\n\nThe correct spelling is:\n\n// Correct spelling 1\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return \nHello World;\n}\n\n// Correct spelling 2\nconst MyComponent = () => \nHello World\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/advanced/hmr.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/advanced/hmr.md"},{"id":20,"title":"REM adaptation","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/advanced/rem","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Enabling REM adaptability","id":"enabling-rem-adaptability","depth":2,"charIndex":207},{"text":"CSS conversion properties","id":"css-conversion-properties","depth":2,"charIndex":456},{"text":"Setting the page rootFontSize","id":"setting-the-page-rootfontsize","depth":2,"charIndex":1104},{"text":"Customize maxRootFontSize","id":"customize-maxrootfontsize","depth":2,"charIndex":1705},{"text":"How to determine if REM is in effect？","id":"how-to-determine-if-rem-is-in-effect？","depth":2,"charIndex":2236},{"text":"How to get the rootFontSize value that is actually in effect on the page?","id":"how-to-get-the-rootfontsize-value-that-is-actually-in-effect-on-the-page?","depth":2,"charIndex":2512}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports REM adaptation via output.convertToRem, which can dynamically\nadjusts the font size according to the screen size, so that the page will be\ndisplayed correctly on different screen sizes.\n\n\nEnabling REM adaptability#\n\nBy setting output.convertToRem, the Builder can do the following things:\n\n * Convert px to rem in CSS.\n * Dynamic setting the fontSize of the root element.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    convertToRem: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nCSS conversion properties#\n\nBy default, rootFontSize is 50.

Install @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider (The version needs to be the same\n    as the Modern.js version).\n\npnpm add @modern-js/builder-rspack-provider -D\n\n\nConfirm the Modern.js version via package.json or lock file:\n\npackage.json\n\n{\n  \"devDependencies\": {\n    \"@modern-js/app-tools\": \"2.8.0\"\n  }\n}\n\n\n 2.

However, due to the different capabilities\nof each bundler, you still need to be aware of some differences.\n\nThis article will introduce the differences between webpack and Rspack from the\nperspective of Builder. If you need to know more in-depth differences, please\nrefer to the Rspack documentation.\n\n\nBuilder configuration differences#\n\nCurrently, most of configuration options in Builder have been adapted for\nRspack. Throughout this process, Builder's work includes but is not limited to:\n\n * Replace features that rely on webpack loader/plugin (which are not supported\n   in Rspack) with alternative solutions provided by Rspack. For example, use\n   css/module instead of css-loader modules.\n * Validating and encapsulating webpack plugins such as @svgr/webpack and\n   webpack-bundle-analyzer;\n * Encapsulating Rspack built-in features such as css and minify.\n\nSource Config#\n\n> Source code parsing and compilation related configurations in Builder.\n\nUnsupported configurations and capabilities include:\n\n * source.include\n * source.exclude\n * source.moduleScopes\n\nHtml Config#\n\n> HTML related configurations in Builder.\n\nAll configurations and capabilities under html are available within rspack.\n\nSecurity Config#\n\n> Security related configurations in Builder.\n\nAll configurations and capabilities under security are not supported for use\nwithin rspack.\n\nDev Config#\n\n> Dev related configurations in Builder.\n\nAll configurations and capabilities under dev are available within rspack.\n\nOutput Config#\n\n> Output related configurations in Builder.\n\nUnsupported configurations and capabilities include:\n\n * output.disableCssExtract\n * output.disableSourcemap.css\n * output.enableAssetManifest\n * output.enableCssModuleTSDeclaration\n * output.legalComments.inline\n * output.enableInlineScripts\n * tsChecker ability\n   * output.disableTsChecker\n\nExperiments Config#\n\n> Experimental related configurations in the Builder\n\nAll configurations and capabilities under experiments are not supported for use\nwithin rspack.\n\nPerformance Config#\n\n> Performance related configurations in Builder.\n\nUnsupported configurations and capabilities include:\n\n * performance.profile\n * performance.removeMomentLocale\n * performance.buildCache\n\nTools Config#\n\n> Low-level tools configurations in Builder.\n\nUnsupported configurations and capabilities include:\n\n * tools.terser\n * tools.cssExtract\n * tools.cssLoader\n * tools.devServer.devMiddleware\n * tools.inspector\n * tools.minifyCss\n * tools.styleLoader\n * tools.styledComponents\n * tools.tsLoader\n * tools.tsChecker\n * tools.webpack\n * tools.webpackChain\n\nTIP\n\nIn addition to the above configurations, some of the supported configurations\nmay have differences in their capabilities. For specific differences in\nconfigurations, please refer to the corresponding API for each configuration.\n\n\nMigrating from webpackChain to bundlerChain#\n\nBuilder supports modifying Rspack config via bundlerChain. configurations\nmodified via bundlerChain will take effect on both webpack and Rspack builds.\n\nTIP\n\nThe bundlerChain only provides consistent api modification for Rspack & webpack\nconfigurations, the actual plugin / loader availability depends on the actual\nRspack / webpack support.\n\n\nCHAIN_ID differences#\n\nBecause of some implementation differences between webpack and Rspack, there are\nsome differences in the rules configuration.\n\nYou can see all the rules that are supported in both Rspack & webpack via\ntools.bundlerChain#CHAIN_ID.\n\n\nModify the Rspack Configuration Object#\n\nBundlerChain only supports modifying the Rspack & webpack intersection config,\nmore Rspack-exclusive features need to be modified via tools.rspack.\n\nBefore modify the Rspack configuration object, you may should know the config\ndiff between Rspack and Webapck.\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    rspack: (config, { env }) => {\n      if (env === 'development') {\n        config.devtool = 'cheap-module-eval-source-map';\n      }\n      return config;\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nMore information about Rspack, please refer to the Rspack website.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/advanced/rspack-start.mdx","_relativePath":"en/guide/advanced/rspack-start.mdx"},{"id":22,"title":"Build Target","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/basic/build-target","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Default Target","id":"default-target","depth":2,"charIndex":363},{"text":"Optional Targets","id":"optional-targets","depth":2,"charIndex":574},{"text":"Multiple Targets","id":"multiple-targets","depth":2,"charIndex":949},{"text":"Node Target","id":"node-target","depth":2,"charIndex":1239},{"text":"Web Worker Target","id":"web-worker-target","depth":2,"charIndex":2071},{"text":"Modern Web Target","id":"modern-web-target","depth":2,"charIndex":3106}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports build multiple target types for running in different target\nenvironments.

At the same time, the upper-level framework will\nalso override some of the default values based on the requirements of the\nvertical scene.\n\nIn most cases, you don't need to define any Builder config, just use it right\nout of the box.\n\n\nUse Config#\n\n\nIn the Upper Framework#\n\nWhen you use a Builder-based upper-level framework, you can define the Builder\nconfig directly through the framework's config file, and the upper-level\nframework will pass the config to the Builder.\n\nFor example, in the Modern.js framework, you can define the Builder's\nsource.alias config in modern.config.ts file.\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    alias: {\n      '@common': './src/common',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nCommonly used framework config files include:\n\nFRAMEWORK   CONFIG FILE\nModern.js   modern.config.ts\nEdenX       edenx.config.ts\nPIA         pia.config.ts\n\n\nUsing the Node API#\n\nWhen you call the Builder through the Node API, you can pass in the Builder\nconfig through the Provider's builderConfig option:\n\n\n\nconst provider = builderWebpackProvider({\n  builderConfig: {\n    // some configs\n  },\n});\n\n\nPlease refer to API - createBuilder for details.\n\n\nRelationship with Framework Config#\n\nGenerally speaking, the Builder config is a subset of the framework config.\n\nBuilder config only deals with build-related behaviors, while framework config\ncovers a wider range, including runtime, server, deployment, etc., so framework\nconfig is extended from Builder config.\n\n\nDebug the config#\n\nYou can enable Builder's debug mode by adding the DEBUG=builder environment\nvariable when executing a build.\n\nDEBUG=builder pnpm dev\n\n\nIn debug mode, Builder will write the Builder config to the dist directory,\nwhich is convenient for developers to view and debug.\n\nInspect config succeed, open the following files to view the content:\n\n   - Builder Config: /Project/demo/dist/builder.config.js\n   - Webpack Config (web): /Project/demo/dist/webpack.config.web.js\n\n\nOpen the generated /dist/builder.config.js file to see the complete content of\nthe Builder config.\n\nFor a complete introduction to debug mode, see the Debug Mode chapter.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/basic/builder-config.mdx","_relativePath":"en/guide/basic/builder-config.mdx"},{"id":24,"title":"Use CSS Modules","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/basic/css-modules","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Example","id":"example","depth":2,"charIndex":539},{"text":"Enable CSS Modules for all CSS files","id":"enable-css-modules-for-all-css-files","depth":2,"charIndex":730},{"text":"Custom Class Names","id":"custom-class-names","depth":2,"charIndex":1355},{"text":"Add Type Declaration","id":"add-type-declaration","depth":2,"charIndex":1706},{"text":"Generate exact type definitions","id":"generate-exact-type-definitions","depth":2,"charIndex":3572},{"text":"Example","id":"example-1","depth":3,"charIndex":4070},{"text":"Related configuration","id":"related-configuration","depth":3,"charIndex":4763}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nCSS Modules allows us to write CSS code in a modular way, and these styles can\nbe imported and used in JavaScript files. Using CSS Modules can automatically\ngenerate unique class names, isolate styles between different modules, and avoid\nclass name conflicts.\n\nBuilder supports CSS Modules by default, you don't need to add additional\nconfiguration. Our convention is to use the [name].module.css filename to enable\nCSS Modules.\n\nThe following style files are considered CSS Modules:\n\n * *.module.scss\n * *.module.less\n * *.module.css\n\n\nExample#\n\n * Write style:\n\n/* button.module.css */\n.error {\n  background: red;\n}\n\n\n * Using styles:\n\n// Button.tsx\n\n// import style file\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  return Error Button;\n};\n\n\n\nEnable CSS Modules for all CSS files#\n\nBy default, only files ending in *.module.css are treated CSS Modules.\n\nIf you want to treat all CSS files in the source directory as CSS Modules, you\ncan enable the output.disableCssModuleExtension config, for example:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    disableCssModuleExtension: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\nWhen set, the following two files are treated as CSS Modules:\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nWe do not recommend enabling this config, because after enabling\ndisableCssModuleExtension, CSS Modules files and ordinary CSS files cannot be\nclearly distinguished, which is not conducive to long-term maintenance.\n\n\nCustom Class Names#\n\nCustomizing the class names generated by CSS Modules is also a commonly used\nfunction, you can use output.cssModuleLocalIdentName to configure it.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    cssModuleLocalIdentName: '[hash:base64:4]',\n  },\n};\n\n\nIf you need to customize other configs of CSS Modules, you can set them via\ntools.cssLoader.\n\n\nAdd Type Declaration#\n\nWhen you import CSS Modules in TypeScript code, TypeScript may prompt that the\nmodule is missing a type definition:\n\nTS2307: Cannot find module './index.module.css' or its corresponding type declarations.\n\n\nTo fix this, you need to add a type declaration file for the CSS Modules, please\ncreate a src/global.d.ts file, and add the corresponding type declaration:\n\nsrc/global.d.ts\n\ndeclare module '*.module.css' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.module.scss' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.module.sass' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.module.less' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.module.styl' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\n\nIf you enabled the disableCssModuleExtension config, you also need to add the\nfollowing types:\n\nsrc/global.d.ts\n\ndeclare module '*.css' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.scss' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.sass' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.less' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*.styl' {\n  const classes: { readonly [key: string]: string };\n  export default classes;\n}\n\n\nAfter adding the type declaration, if the type error still exists, you can try\nto restart the current IDE, or adjust the directory where global.d.ts is\nlocated, making sure the TypeScript can correctly identify the type definition.\n\n\nGenerate exact type definitions#\n\nAlthough the above method can provide the type of CSS Modules, it cannot\naccurately prompt which classNames are exported by a certain CSS file.\n\nBuilder supports generating accurate type declarations for CSS Modules, you only\nneed to enable the output.enableCssModuleTSDeclaration config, and then execute\nthe build, Builder will generate type declaration files for all CSS Modules.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    enableCssModuleTSDeclaration: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nExample#\n\nFor example, there are two files src/index.ts and src/index.module.scss under a\ncertain folder:\n\nsrc/index.ts\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  \n\n    \nPage Header\n  ;\n};\n\n\nsrc/index.module.scss\n\n.page-header {\n  color: black;\n}\n\n\nAfter executing the build, the src/index.module.scss.d.ts type declaration file\nwill be automatically generated:\n\nsrc/index.module.scss.d.ts\n\n// This file is automatically generated.\n// Please do not change this file!\ninterface CssExports {\n  'page-header': string;\n  pageHeader: string;\n}\nexport const cssExports: CssExports;\nexport default cssExports;\n\n\nThen open the src/index.ts file again, you will see that the styles object\nalready has a exact type.\n\n\nRelated configuration#\n\nIn the above example, src/index.module.scss.d.ts is generated by compilation,\nyou can choose to commit them to the Git repository, or you can choose to ignore\nthem in the .gitignore file:\n\n# Ignore auto generated CSS declarations\n*.module.css.d.ts\n*.module.sass.d.ts\n*.module.scss.d.ts\n*.module.less.d.ts\n*.module.styl.d.ts\n\n\nIn addition, if the generated code causes ESLint to report errors, you can also\nadd the above configuration to the .eslintignore file.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/basic/css-modules.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/basic/css-modules.md"},{"id":25,"title":"CSS

By default, the compiled\nfiles will be output in the dist directory of current project.\n\ndist\n├── static\n│   ├── css\n│   │   ├── [name].[hash].css\n│   │   └── [name].[hash].css.map\n│   │\n│   └── js\n│       ├── [name].[hash].js\n│       ├── [name].[hash].js.LICENSE.txt\n│       └── [name].[hash].js.map\n│\n└── html\n    └── [name]\n        └── index.html\n\n\nThe most common output files are HTML files, JS files, and CSS files:\n\n * HTML files: default output to the html directory.\n * JS files: default output to static/js directory,\n * CSS files: default output to the static/css directory.\n\nIn addition, JS files and CSS files sometimes generate some related files:\n\n * License files: contains open source license, which is output to the same\n   level directory of the JS file, and adds .LICENSE.txt suffix.\n * Source Map files: contains the source code mappings, which is output to the\n   same level directory of JS files and CSS files, and adds a .map suffix.\n\nIn the filename, [name] represents the entry name corresponding to this file,\nsuch as index, main. [hash] is the hash value generated based on the content of\nthe file.\n\n\nModify the Directory#\n\nBuilder provides some configs to modify the directory or filename, you can:\n\n * Modify the filename through output.filename.\n * Modify the output path of through output.distPath.\n * Modify the license file through output.legalComments.\n * Remove Source Map file through output.disableSourceMap.\n * Remove the folder corresponding to the HTML files through\n   html.disableHtmlFolder.\n\n\nStatic Assets#\n\nWhen you import static assets such as images, SVG, fonts, media, etc. in the\ncode, they will also be output to the dist/static directory, and automatically\nassigned to the corresponding subdirectories according to the file type:\n\ndist\n└── static\n    ├── image\n    │   └── foo.[hash].png\n    │\n    ├── svg\n    │   └── bar.[hash].svg\n    │\n    ├── font\n    │   └── baz.[hash].woff2\n    │\n    └── media\n        └── qux.[hash].mp4\n\n\nYou can use the output.distPath config to uniformly input these static assets\ninto a directory, for example, output to the assets directory:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    distPath: {\n      image: 'assets',\n      svg: 'assets',\n      font: 'assets',\n      media: 'assets',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe above config produces the following directory structure:\n\ndist\n└── assets\n    ├── foo.[hash].png\n    ├── bar.[hash].svg\n    ├── baz.[hash].woff2\n    └── qux.[hash].mp4\n\n\n\nNode.js Output Directory#\n\nWhen the Build Target of Builder contains 'node', or you have enabled\nserver-side features such as SSR in the upper framework, Builder will generate\nsome output files for Node.js and output them to the bundles directory:\n\ndist\n├── bundles\n│   └── [name].js\n├── static\n└── html\n\n\nNode.js files usually only contain JS files, no HTML or CSS. Also, JS file names\nwill not contain hash.\n\nYou can modify the output path of Node.js files through the\noutput.distPath.server config.\n\nFor example, output Node.js files to the server directory:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    distPath: {\n      server: 'server',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nFlatten the Directory#\n\nSometimes you don't want the dist directory to have too many levels, you can set\nthe directory to an empty string to flatten the generated directory.\n\nSee the example below:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    distPath: {\n      js: '',\n      css: '',\n      html: '',\n    },\n    disableHtmlFolder: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe above config produces the following directory structure:\n\ndist\n├── [name].[hash].css\n├── [name].[hash].css.map\n├── [name].[hash].js\n├── [name].[hash].js.map\n└── [name].html\n\n\n\nNot Written to Disk#\n\nBy default, Builder will write the generated files to disk, so developers can\nview the file content or configure proxy rules for static assets.\n\nIn development, you can choose to keep the generated files in the Dev Server's\nmemory to reduce the overhead of file operations.\n\nJust set the dev.writeToDisk config to false:\n\nexport default {\n  dev: {\n    writeToDisk: false,\n  },\n};\n","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/basic/output-files.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/basic/output-files.md"},{"id":29,"title":"Import Static Assets","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/basic/static-assets","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Assets Format","id":"assets-format","depth":2,"charIndex":586},{"text":"Import Assets in JS file","id":"import-assets-in-js-file","depth":2,"charIndex":1097},{"text":"Import Assets in CSS file","id":"import-assets-in-css-file","depth":2,"charIndex":1346},{"text":"Import Results","id":"import-results","depth":2,"charIndex":1597},{"text":"Output Files","id":"output-files","depth":2,"charIndex":2136},{"text":"URL Prefix","id":"url-prefix","depth":2,"charIndex":2384},{"text":"Add Type Declaration","id":"add-type-declaration","depth":2,"charIndex":2757},{"text":"Image Format","id":"image-format","depth":2,"charIndex":3548}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports import static assets, including images, fonts, and medias.\n\nWhat is Static Assets\n\nStatic assets are files that are part of a web application and do not change,\neven when the application is being used. Examples of static assets include\nimages, fonts, medias, stylesheets, and JavaScript files. These assets are\ntypically stored on a web server or CDN, and delivered to the user's web browser\nwhen the Web application is accessed. Because they do not change, static assets\ncan be cached by the browser, which helps to improve the performance of the Web\napplication.\n\n\nAssets Format#\n\nThe following are the formats supported by Builder by default:\n\n * Image: png, jpg, jpeg, gif, svg, bmp, webp, ico, apng, avif, tiff.\n * Fonts: woff, woff2, eot, ttf, otf, ttc.\n * Media: mp4, webm, ogg, mp3, wav, flac, aac, mov.\n\nIf you need to import static resources in other formats, please provide feedback\nthrough GitHub Issues.\n\nSVG images\n\nSVG image is a special case. Builder support convert SVG to React components, so\nSVG is processed separately. For details, see Import SVG Assets.\n\n\nImport Assets in JS file#\n\nIn JS files, you can directly import static assets in relative paths:\n\n// Import the logo.png image in the static directory\n\n\nexport default = () => ;\n\n\nImport with alias are also supported:\n\n\n\nexport default = () => ;\n\n\n\nImport Assets in CSS file#\n\nIn CSS files, you can reference static assets in relative paths:\n\n.logo {\n  background-image: url('../static/logo.png');\n}\n\n\nImport with alias are also supported:\n\n.logo {\n  background-image: url('@/static/logo.png');\n}\n\n\n\nImport Results#\n\nThe result of importing static assets depends on the file size:\n\n * When the file size is greater than 10KB, a URL will be returned, and the file\n   will be output to the dist directory.\n * When the file size is less than 10KB, it will be automatically inlined to\n   Base64 format.\n\n\n\n\nconsole.log(largeImage); // \"/static/largeImage.6c12aba3.png\"\nconsole.log(smallImage); // \"data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgo...\"\n\n\nFor a more detailed introduction to asset inlining, please refer to the Static\nAsset Inlining chapter.\n\n\nOutput Files#\n\nWhen static assets are imported, they will be output to the dist directory. You\ncan:\n\n * Modify the output filename through output.filename.\n * Modify the output path through output.distPath.\n\nPlease read Output Files for details.\n\n\nURL Prefix#\n\nThe URL returned after importing a asset will automatically include the path\nprefix:\n\n * In development, using dev.assetPrefix to set the path prefix.\n * In production, using output.assetPrefix to set the path prefix.\n\nFor example, you can set output.assetPrefix to https://modern.com:\n\n\n\nconsole.log(logo); // \"https://modern.com/static/logo.6c12aba3.png\"\n\n\n\nAdd Type Declaration#\n\nWhen you import static assets in TypeScript code, TypeScript may prompt that the\nmodule is missing a type definition:\n\nTS2307: Cannot find module './logo.png' or its corresponding type declarations.\n\n\nTo fix this, you need to add a type declaration file for the static assets,\nplease create a src/global.d.ts file, and add the corresponding type\ndeclaration. Taking png images as an example, you need to add the following\ndeclarations:\n\nsrc/global.d.ts\n\ndeclare module '*.png' {\n  const content: string;\n  export default content;\n}\n\n\nAfter adding the type declaration, if the type error still exists, you can try\nto restart the current IDE, or adjust the directory where global.d.ts is\nlocated, making sure the TypeScript can correctly identify the type definition.\n\n\nImage Format#\n\nWhen using image assets, you can choose a appropriate image format according to\nthe pros and cons in the table below.\n\nFORMAT   PROS                                                     CONS                                                         SCENARIOS\nPNG      Lossless compression, no loss of picture details, no     Not suitable for pictures with complex color tables          Suitable for pictures with few colors and well-defined\n         distortion, support for translucency                                                                                  borders, suitable for logos, icons, transparent images and\n                                                                                                                               other scenes\nJPG      Rich colors                                              Lossy compression, which will cause image distortion, does   Suitable for pictures with a large number of colors,\n                                                                  not support transparency                                     gradients, and overly complex pictures, suitable for\n                                                                                                                               portrait photos, landscapes and other scenes\nWebP     Supports both lossy and lossless compression, supports   iOS compatibility is not good                                Pixel images of almost any scene, and the hosting\n         transparency, and is much smaller than PNG and JPG                                                                    environment that supports WebP, should prefer WebP image\n                                                                                                                               format\nSVG      Lossless format, no distortion, supports transparency    Not suitable for complex graphics                            Suitable for vector graphics, suitable for icons","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/basic/static-assets.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/basic/static-assets.md"},{"id":30,"title":"Import SVG Assets","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/basic/svg-assets","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Import SVG in JS file","id":"import-svg-in-js-file","depth":2,"charIndex":506},{"text":"Modify the Default Export","id":"modify-the-default-export","depth":2,"charIndex":906},{"text":"Import SVG in CSS file","id":"import-svg-in-css-file","depth":2,"charIndex":1279},{"text":"Assets Processing","id":"assets-processing","depth":2,"charIndex":1470},{"text":"Disable SVGR Processing","id":"disable-svgr-processing","depth":2,"charIndex":1804},{"text":"Add type declaration","id":"add-type-declaration","depth":2,"charIndex":2210}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports import SVG assets and transform SVG into React components or\nURLs.\n\nWhat is SVG\n\nSVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. It is a type of image format that uses\nvector graphics to represent images. Vector graphics are different from raster\ngraphics, which are made up of pixels. Instead, vector graphics use geometric\nshapes, lines, and curves to represent images. Because vector graphics are not\nmade up of pixels, they can be scaled to any size without losing resolution or\nquality.\n\n\nImport SVG in JS file#\n\nWhen import an SVG in a JS file, if you import ReactComponent, Builder will call\nSVGR to convert the SVG into a React component.\n\nsrc/component/Logo.tsx\n\n\n\nexport default () => ;\n\n\nIf you use the default import, then the SVG will be treated as a normal static\nasset and you will get a URL:\n\nsrc/component/Logo.tsx\n\n\n\nconsole.log(logoURL); // => \"/static/logo.6c12aba3.png\"\n\n\n\nModify the Default Export#\n\nYou can modify the default export of SVG files through the\noutput.svgDefaultExport config. For example, set the default export as a React\ncomponent:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    svgDefaultExport: 'component',\n  },\n};\n\n\nThen import the SVG, you'll get a React component instead of a URL:\n\nsrc/component/Logo.tsx\n\n\n\nexport default () => ;\n\n\n\nImport SVG in CSS file#\n\nWhen import an SVG in a CSS file, the SVG is treated as a normal static resource\nand you will get a URL:\n\n.logo {\n  background-image: url('../static/logo.svg');\n}\n\n\n\nAssets Processing#\n\nWhen SVG is imported not as a React component but as a normal static resource,\nit is processed exactly the same as other static assets, and it is also affected\nby rules such as assets inlining and URL prefixing.\n\nPlease read the Import Static Assets section to understand the processing rules\nfor static assets.\n\n\nDisable SVGR Processing#\n\nBy default, when an SVG resource is referenced in a JS file, Builder will call\nSVGR to convert the SVG into a React component. If you are sure that all SVG\nresources in your project are not being used as React components, you can turn\noff this conversion by setting disableSvgr to true to improve build performance.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    disableSvgr: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nAdd type declaration#\n\nWhen you reference an SVG asset in TypeScript code, TypeScript may prompt that\nthe module is missing a type definition:\n\nTS2307: Cannot find module './logo.svg' or its corresponding type declarations.\n\n\nTo fix this, you need to add a type declaration file for the SVG asset, please\ncreate a src/global.d.ts file, and add the following type declaration:\n\ndeclare module '*.svg' {\n  export const ReactComponent: React.FunctionComponent<\n    React.SVGProps\n  >;\n\n  const content: string;\n  export default content;\n}\n\n\nIf you set svgDefaultExport to 'component', then change the type declaration to:\n\ndeclare module '*.svg' {\n  export const ReactComponent: React.FunctionComponent<\n    React.SVGProps\n  >;\n\n  export default ReactComponent;\n}\n\n\nAfter adding the type declaration, if the type error still exists, you can try\nto restart the current IDE, or adjust the directory where global.d.ts is\nlocated, making sure the TypeScript can correctly identify the type definition.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/basic/svg-assets.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/basic/svg-assets.md"},{"id":31,"title":"Use TypeScript","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/basic/typescript","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"TypeScript compilation","id":"typescript-compilation","depth":2,"charIndex":151},{"text":"Why Babel is the default option","id":"why-babel-is-the-default-option","depth":3,"charIndex":1325},{"text":"Type checking","id":"type-checking","depth":2,"charIndex":1812}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports TypeScript compilation and type checking by default, you can\nuse . ts and `. tsx' files in the project without any configuration.\n\n\nTypeScript compilation#\n\nBuilder has three ways to compile TypeScript files.\n\nBabel\n\nBy default, all TypeScript files are compiled by Babel.\n\nYou may find some old articles pointing out that Babel cannot handle const enum\nand namespace alias syntax, however since version 7.15 Babel has supported them.\nBabel compile is enabled by default.\n\nIf you want more Babel plugins\n\nts-loader\n\nThe ts-loader uses TypeScript's official compiler-TSC under the hood.

It cannot check types, but we can check types in\nanother process. Babel follows standards more when compiled to lower versions of\nJavaScript in certain situations. For example, Babel will initialize class\nmembers as undefined, and mark class methods as non-enumerable. If TSC is\nenabled, for better syntax downgrading and Polyfill, the TSC output will still\nbe compiled by Babel, causing unnecessary performance costs.\n\n\nType checking#\n\nCurrently, the only stable TypeScript type checking tool is TSC, and it usually\ntakes a while to check types in a large project, so Builder by default using\ntsChecker(fork-ts-checker-webpack-plugin) for asynchronous type checking, it\nwon't block project setup.\n\nSet tsChecker(with default options):\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    tsChecker: {},\n  },\n};\n\n\nMore configurations can be seen at tsChecker configuration.\n\nNote that if ts-loader is enabled and compileOnly: false is set, please disable\ntsChecker to avoid duplicate type-checking.\n\nSTC\n\nThe author of SWC has announced a new open-source type-checking tool based on\nRust, which is called STC, it's super fast but it cannot used for production\nnow, really don't recommend you use that for now, when it's stabled we will use\nthat in Builder SWC plugin as experimental ability.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/basic/typescript.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/basic/typescript.md"},{"id":32,"title":"Import Wasm Assets","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/basic/wasm-assets","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Import","id":"import","depth":2,"charIndex":395},{"text":"Output Directory","id":"output-directory","depth":2,"charIndex":779},{"text":"Add Type Declaration","id":"add-type-declaration","depth":2,"charIndex":1078}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBuilder supports import WebAssembly assets in code.\n\nWhat is WebAssembly\n\nWebAssembly (Wasm) is a portable, high-performance binary format designed to\nexecute CPU-intensive computing tasks in modern web browsers, bringing\nperformance and reliability similar to native compiled code to the web platform.\n\nINFO\n\nIf you are using Rspack as the bundler, import Wasm assets is not supported yet.\n\n\nImport#\n\nYou can import a WebAssembly module directly in a JavaScript file:\n\nindex.js\n\n\n\nconsole.log(add);

The webpack dependency is directly declared in the project's package.json,\n    and the version range of the webpack that the Builder depends on is\n    different and cannot match the same version.\n 2. Multiple npm packages installed in the project all depend on webpack, and\n    the webpack version ranges they depend on are different and cannot match the\n    same version.\n 3. Due to the lock mechanism of the package manager, multiple webpack versions\n    are generated in the lock file.\n\nIn the first case, it is recommended to remove the webpack dependency from the\nproject's package.json. Because Builder encapsulates webpack-related\ncapabilities by default, and will pass in the webpack object in the\ntools.webpack configuration item. Therefore, in most cases, it is not\nrecommended to install additional webpack dependencies in the project.\n\nIn the second case, it is recommended to see if you can upgrade an npm package\nso that its dependent webpack version range is consistent with the Builder. It\nis also possible to manually unify versions through the ability of the package\nmanager, e.g. using yarn resolutions or [pnpm overrides](https\n://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides).\n\nIf it is the third case, you can use the two methods mentioned in the second\ncase, or you can try to delete the lock file and reinstall it to solve it.\n\nTIP\n\nDeleting the lock file will automatically upgrade the dependency version in the\nproject to the latest version under the specified scope, please test it\nthoroughly.\n\n\nFind ES6+ code in the compiled files?#\n\nBy default, Builder will not compile files under node_modules through\nbabel-loader or ts-loader. If the npm package introduced by the project contains\nES6+ syntax, it will be packaged into the product.\n\nWhen this happens, you can specify directories or modules that need to be\ncompiled additionally through the source.include configuration item.\n\n\nFailed import other modules in Monorepo?#\n\nFor the sake of compilation performance, by default, Builder will not compile\nfiles under node_modules through babel-loader or ts-loader, nor will it compile\nfiles outside the current project directory.\n\nThrough the source.include configuration item, you can specify directories or\nmodules that require additional compilation.\n\nFor details, see source.include usage introduction.\n\n\nCompile error You may need additional loader?#\n\nIf the following error message is encountered during the compilation process, it\nmeans that there are individual files that cannot be compiled correctly.\n\nModule parse failed: Unexpected token\nFile was processed with these loaders:\n * some-loader/index.js\n\nYou may need an additional loader to handle the result of these loaders.\n\n\nSolution:\n\n * If the .ts file outside the current project is referenced, or the .ts file\n   under node_modules, please add the source.include configuration Items that\n   specify files that require additional compilation.\n * If you refer to a file format that is not supported by Builder, please\n   configure the corresponding webpack loader for compilation.\n\n\nFind exports is not defined runtime error?#\n\nIf the compilation is succeed, but the exports is not defined error appears\nafter opening the page, it is usually because a CommonJS module is compiled by\nbabel.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, Builder will not use babel to compile CommonJS\nmodules. If the source.include configuration item is used in the project, or the\n[tools.babel](/en/api/config-tools.html#tools -babel) addIncludes method, some\nCommonJS modules may be added to the babel compilation.\n\nThere are two workarounds for this problem:\n\n 1. Avoid adding CommonJS modules to babel compilation.\n 2. Set babel's sourceType configuration item to unambiguous, for example:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    babel(config) {\n      config.sourceType = 'unambiguous';\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nSetting sourceType to unambiguous may have some other effects, please refer to\nbabel official documentation.\n\n\nCompile error \"Error: ES Modules may not assign module.exports or exports.*, Use\nESM export syntax\"?#\n\nIf the following error occurs during compilation, it is usually because a\nCommonJS module is compiled with babel in the project, and the solution is same\nas the above exports is not defined problem.\n\nError: ES Modules may not assign module.exports or exports.*, Use ESM export syntax, instead: 581\n\n\nFor more information, please refer to issue: babel#12731.\n\n\nThe compilation progress bar is stuck, but there is no Error log in the\nterminal?#\n\nWhen the compilation progress bar is stuck, but there is no Error log on the\nterminal, it is usually because an exception occurred during the compilation. In\nsome cases, when Error is caught by webpack or other modules, the error log can\nnot be output correctly. The most common scenario is that there is an exception\nin the Babel config, which is caught by webpack, and webpack swallows the Error\nin some cases.\n\nSolution:\n\nIf this problem occurs after you modify the Babel config, it is recommended to\ncheck for the following incorrect usages:\n\n 1. You have configured a plugin or preset that does not exist, maybe the name\n    is misspelled, or it is not installed correctly.\n\n// wrong example\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    babel(config, { addPlugins }) {\n      // The plugin has the wrong name or is not installed\n      addPlugins('babel-plugin-not-exists');\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n 2. Whether multiple babel-plugin-imports are configured, but the name of each\n    babel-plugin-import is not declared in the third item of the array.\n\n// wrong example\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    babel(config, { addPlugins }) {\n      addPlugins([\n        [\n          'babel-plugin-import',\n          { libraryName: 'antd', libraryDirectory: 'es' },\n        ],\n        [\n          'babel-plugin-import',\n          { libraryName: 'antd-mobile', libraryDirectory: 'es' },\n        ],\n      ]);\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n// correct example\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    babel(config, { addPlugins }) {\n      addPlugins([\n        [\n          'babel-plugin-import',\n          { libraryName: 'antd', libraryDirectory: 'es' },\n          'antd',\n        ],\n        [\n          'babel-plugin-import',\n          { libraryName: 'antd-mobile', libraryDirectory: 'es' },\n          'antd-mobile',\n        ],\n      ]);\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nThe webpack cache does not work?#\n\nBuilder enables webpack's persistent cache by default.\n\nAfter the first compilation is completed, the cache file will be automatically\ngenerated and output to the ./node_modules/.cache/webpack directory. When the\nsecond compilation is performed, the cache is hit and the compilation speed is\ngreatly improved.\n\nWhen configuration files such as package.json are modified, the cache is\nautomatically invalidated.\n\nIf the webpack compilation cache in the project has not taken effect, you can\nadd the following configuration for troubleshooting:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpack(config) {\n      config.infrastructureLogging = {\n        ...config.infrastructureLogging,\n        debug: /webpack\\.cache/,\n      };\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nAfter adding the above configuration, webpack will output logs for debugging.\nPlease refer to the logs related to PackFileCacheStrategy to understand the\ncause of cache invalidation.\n\n\nTree shaking does not take effect?#\n\nBuilder will enable the tree shaking function of webpack by default during\nproduction construction. Whether tree shaking can take effect depends on whether\nthe business code can meet the tree shaking conditions of webpack.\n\nIf you encounter the problem that tree shaking does not take effect, you can\ncheck whether the sideEffects configuration of the relevant npm package is\ncorrect. If you don't know what sideEffects is, or are interested in the\nprinciples behind tree shaking, you can read the following two documents:\n\n * webpack official documentation - Tree Shaking\n * Tree Shaking Troubleshooting Guide\n\n\nJavaScript heap out of memory when compiling?#\n\nThis error indicates that there is a memory overflow problem during the\npackaging process. In most cases, it is because the packaged content exceeds the\ndefault memory limit of Node.js.\n\nIn case of OOM issues, the easiest way to fix this is by increasing the memory\ncap, Node.js provides the --max-old-space-size option to set this. You can set\nthis parameter by adding NODE_OPTIONS before the CLI command.\n\nFor example, add parameters before the modern build command:\n\npackage.json\n\n{\n   \"scripts\": {\n- \"build\": \"modern build\"\n+ \"build\": \"NODE_OPTIONS=--max_old_space_size=16384 modern build\"\n   }\n}\n\n\nIf you are executing other commands, such as modern deploy, please add\nparameters before the corresponding command.\n\nThe value of the max_old_space_size parameter represents the upper limit of the\nmemory size (MB). Generally, it can be set to 16384 (16GB).\n\nThe following parameters are explained in more detail in the official Node.js\ndocumentation:\n\n * NODE_OPTIONS\n * --max-old-space-size\n\nIn addition to increasing the memory limit, it is also a solution to improve\nefficiency by enabling some compilation strategies, please refer to Improve\nBuild Performance.\n\nIf the above methods cannot solve your problem, it may be that some abnormal\nlogic in the project has caused memory overflow. You can debug recent code\nchanges and locate the root cause of problems. If it cannot be located, please\ncontact us.\n\n\nCan't resolve 'core-js/modules/xxx.js' when compiling?#\n\nIf you get an error similar to the following when compiling, it means that\ncore-js cannot be resolved properly in the project.\n\nModule not found: Can't resolve 'core-js/modules/es.error.cause.js'\n\n\nUsually, you don't need to install core-js in the project, because the Builder\nalready has a built-in core-js v3.\n\nIf there is an error that core-js cannot be found, there may be several reasons:\n\n 1. The plugins configured by Babel is overwritten in the project, causing the\n    built-in babelPluginLockCorejsVersion does not work. In this case, just\n    change tools.babel to a function:\n\n// Wrong usage, will override Builder's default Babel plugins\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    babel: {\n      plugins: ['babel-plugin-xxx'],\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n// Correct usage, add a new plugin in the default configuration instead of overriding the plugin\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    babel(config) {\n      config.plugins.push('babel-plugin-xxx');\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n 2. Some code in the project depends on core-js v2. In this case, you usually\n    need to find out the corresponding code and upgrade core-js to the v3.\n 3. An npm package in node_modules imported core-js, but does not declare the\n    core-js dependency in dependencies. In this case, you need to declare the\n    core-js dependency in the corresponding npm package, or install a copy of\n    core-js in the project root directory.\n\n\nHMR not work when updating React components?#\n\nBuilder uses React's official Fast Refresh capability to perform component hot\nupdates.\n\nIf there is a problem that the hot update of the React component cannot take\neffect, or the state of the React component is lost after the hot update, it is\nusually because your React component uses an anonymous function. In the official\npractice of React Fast Refresh, it is required that the component cannot be an\nanonymous function, otherwise the state of the React component cannot be\npreserved after hot update.\n\nHere are some examples of wrong usage:\n\n// bad\nexport default function () {\n  return \nHello World;\n}\n\n// bad\nexport default () => \nHello World;\n\n\nThe correct usage is to declare a name for each component function:\n\n// good\nexport default function MyComponent() {\n  return \nHello World;\n}\n\n// good\nconst MyComponent = () => \nHello World;\n\nexport default MyComponent;\n\n\n\nCompilation error after referencing a type from lodash#\n\nIf the @types/lodash package is installed in your project, you may import some\ntypes from lodash, such as the DebouncedFunc type:\n\n\n\n\nBuilder will throw an error after compiling the above code:\n\nSyntax error: /project/src/index.ts: The lodash method `DebouncedFunc` is not a known module.\nPlease report bugs to https://github.com/lodash/babel-plugin-lodash/issues.\n\n\nThe reason is that Builder has enabled the babel-plugin-lodash plugin by default\nto optimize the bundle size of lodash, but Babel cannot distinguish between\n\"value\" and \"type\", which resulting in an exception in the compiled code.\n\nThe solution is to use TypeScript's import type syntax to explicitly declare the\nDebouncedFunc type:\n\n\n\n\n\nTIP\n\nIn any case, it is recommended to use import type to import types, this will\nhelp the compiler to identify the type.\n\n\nDivision in Less file doesn't work?#\n\nCompared with the v3 version, the Less v4 version has some differences in the\nway of writing division:\n\n// Less v3\n.math {\n  width: 2px / 2; // 1px\n  width: 2px ./ 2; // 1px\n  width: (2px / 2); // 1px\n}\n\n// Less v4\n.math {\n  width: 2px / 2; // 2px / 2\n  width: 2px ./ 2; // 1px\n  width: (2px / 2); // 1px\n}\n\n\nThe built-in Less version of Builder is v4, and the writing method of the lower\nversion will not take effect. Please pay attention to the distinction.\n\nThe writing of division in Less can also be modified through configuration\nitems, see Less - Math.\n\n\nCompile error ‘TypeError: Cannot delete property 'xxx' of #’#\n\nThis error indicates that a read-only configuration item was deleted during the\ncompilation process. Normally, we do not want any operation to directly modify\nthe incoming configuration when compiling, but it is difficult to restrict the\nbehavior of underlying plugins (such as postcss-loader, etc). If this error\noccurs, please contact the builder developer and we will need to do something\nspecial with that configuration.\n\nThe same type of error is also reported:\n\n * 'TypeError: Cannot add property xxx, object is not extensible'\n * 'TypeError: Cannot assign to read only property 'xxx' of object '#'","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/faq/exceptions.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/faq/exceptions.md"},{"id":36,"title":"Features","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/faq/features","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"How to import UI Component library on demand?","id":"how-to-import-ui-component-library-on-demand?","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"How to run ESLint during compilation?","id":"how-to-run-eslint-during-compilation?","depth":2,"charIndex":400},{"text":"How to configure CDN path for static assets?","id":"how-to-configure-cdn-path-for-static-assets?","depth":2,"charIndex":1075},{"text":"How to clear the webpack cache?","id":"how-to-clear-the-webpack-cache?","depth":2,"charIndex":1376},{"text":"How to remove console after production build?","id":"how-to-remove-console-after-production-build?","depth":2,"charIndex":1626}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\n\nHow to import UI Component library on demand?#\n\nIf you need to configure the on-demand import of the component library, you can\nconfigure it through source.transformImport, which is equivalent to\nbabel-plugin-import.\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    transformImport: [\n      {\n        libraryName: 'xxx-components',\n        libraryDirectory: 'es',\n        style: true,\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nHow to run ESLint during compilation?#\n\nFor the sake of compilation performance, Builder will not perform ESLint\nverification during the compilation process by default.

For most developers, the configuration and dependencies\nrequired to build a web application have become complex; the cost of finding\nbest practices for developers has also risen.\n\nIn order to reduce the complexity and make it easier to build a project, we\nabstracted the build abilities based on the practical experience of Modern.js,\nand created the open source tool Modern.js Builder.\n\n\nRust Tools#\n\nIn recent years, the trend in front-end toolchain has been to re-implement them\nwith native programming languages like Rust for better performance. Some\nhigh-performance tools have created, such as SWC, Rspack, etc., and their use is\ngradually expanding. However, there are many differences between these Rust\ntools and JavaScript tools, including functional differences, configuration\ninconsistencies, which make it difficult for users to migrate.\n\nThe Rust process of the front-end toolchain will continue for a long time,\nModern.js Builder is expected to help developers better transition to Rust\ntools. Whether it's JavaScript tools, Rust tools, or even low-level bundlers\nlike webpack, they're all replaceable components in Modern.js Builder. You can\nincrementally replace these components by turning on configuration or enabling\nplugins, and Modern.js Builder will smooth out the major differences and help\nusers migrate.\n\n\nPosition#\n\nModern.js Builder is a build engine serving the upper-level front-end\nframeworks. It focuses on solving problems in web application building, and\nexpects to provide out-of-box building abilities for front-end frameworks.\n\nIf you are developing a front-end framework, or developing a scaffolding for a\nfront-end application, Builder can provide most of the build logics for you,\nwhich allowing you to focus on implementing other features of the framework.\n\nIf you are a business developer, in most cases, you do not need to manually\ninstall Builder in your projects. We recommend that you use the upper-level\nframeworks based on Builder.\n\nCurrently, the following front-end frameworks are already using Builder:\n\n * Modern.js Framework (Open source).\n * EdenX Framework and PIA Framework inside ByteDance.\n\n\nFeatures#\n\n\nSupport Rspack Build#\n\nBuilder supports both webpack and Rspack, so you can switch between the stable\nWebpack and the faster Rspack.\n\nBy default, Builder uses webpack 5 as the bundler. Although the compilation\nspeed of webpack is not ideal, it is still the most mature and ecological\nbundler in the community. Based on webpack, Builder integrates babel, postcss,\nterser and other tools to transform or minify codes. Builder also supports\nreplacing some compile tools with native tools to improve compilation speed,\nsuch as replacing babel/terser with swc or esbuild.\n\nIf you have higher build performance requirements, you can easily switch to\nRspack build mode, see Using Rspack for more information.\n\n\nDeep optimization#\n\nBuilder makes full use of various optimization strategies in the webpack\necosystem to ensure the product performance in the production environment.\n\nTaking the chunk splitting scenario as an example, the webpack's splitChunks\nconfig is complex, and Builder makes it as an out-of-the-box\nperformance.chunkSplit config, it will split common third-party libraries into\nchunks to make page loading faster.\n\n\nExtensible Plugin System#\n\nProvides rich configuration items and a flexible plugin system to support\nin-depth customization of all features.\n\nFor Builder, all building abilities are achieved through plugins:\n\n * Most of the plugins are lightweight, built in Builder, and developers can\n   enable or disable them through configs.\n * Some plugins are more complex and developed as independent npm packages,\n   developers can install and use them as needed.\n\nBuilder also supports custom plugins, so framework developers can develop custom\nplugins to meet customized requirements.\n\n\nnpm packages#\n\nBelow is the npm package published by Builder.\n\nPACKAGE                                    VERSION   DESCRIPTION\n@modern-js/builder                                   Core package of Builder\n@modern-js/builder-webpack-provider                  Provides webpack build ability\n@modern-js/builder-rspack-provider                   Provides Rspack build ability\n@modern-js/builder-plugin-swc                        SWC Plugin\n@modern-js/builder-plugin-stylus                     Stylus Plugin\n@modern-js/builder-plugin-esbuild                    Esbuild Plugin\n@modern-js/builder-plugin-node-polyfill              Node Polyfill Plugin\n@modern-js/builder-plugin-image-compress             Image Compress Plugin\n@modern-js/builder-shared                            Shared modules of Builder\n@modern-js/builder-doc                               Documentation snippets of Builder\n\nYou can view the source code of these packages in the packages/builder directory\nof the modern.js repository.\n\n\nNext Step#\n\nYou may want:","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/introduction.mdx","_relativePath":"en/guide/introduction.mdx"},{"id":41,"title":"Improve Build Performance","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/optimization/build-performance","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"General optimization strategy","id":"general-optimization-strategy","depth":2,"charIndex":408},{"text":"Upgrade Node.js version","id":"upgrade-nodejs-version","depth":3,"charIndex":609},{"text":"Using Rspack build","id":"using-rspack-build","depth":3,"charIndex":1271},{"text":"Using SWC or esbuild","id":"using-swc-or-esbuild","depth":3,"charIndex":1428},{"text":"Avoid using ts-loader","id":"avoid-using-ts-loader","depth":3,"charIndex":2385},{"text":"Development optimization strategies","id":"development-optimization-strategies","depth":2,"charIndex":2802},{"text":"Enable Lazy Compilation","id":"enable-lazy-compilation","depth":3,"charIndex":2929},{"text":"Adjust Source Map format","id":"adjust-source-map-format","depth":3,"charIndex":3305},{"text":"Adjust Browserslist for development","id":"adjust-browserslist-for-development","depth":3,"charIndex":4193},{"text":"Production optimization strategies","id":"production-optimization-strategies","depth":2,"charIndex":5005},{"text":"Disable Source Map","id":"disable-source-map","depth":3,"charIndex":5130}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModern.js Builder optimizes build performance by default, but as the project\nbecomes larger, you may encounter some build performance problems.\n\nThis document provides some optional speed-up strategies, developers can choose\nsome of them to improve the build performance.\n\n📢 Notice\n\nThe strategies in Bundle Size Optimization can also be used to improve build\nperformance, so we won't repeat them here.\n\n\nGeneral optimization strategy#\n\nThe following are some general optimization strategies, which can speed up the\ndevelopment build and production build, and some of them also optimize the\nbundle size.\n\n\nUpgrade Node.js version#\n\nIn general, updating Node.js to the latest LTS release will help improve build\nperformance.\n\nEspecially for devices with Apple M1/M2 chips, it is recommended to use Node 16\nor Node 18.\n\nNode 16 provides Apple Silicon binaries by default, so the performance on M1/M2\nmodels will be greatly improved than Node 14. According to our tests, After\nswitching from Node 14 to Node 16, the compilation speed can be improved by more\nthan 100%.\n\nYou can switch to Node 16 by following steps:\n\n# Install Node.js v16\nnvm install 16\n\n# switch to Node 16\nnvm use 16\n\n# Set Node 16 as the default version\nnvm default 16\n\n# View Node version\nnode -v\n\n\n\nUsing Rspack build#\n\nIf you have higher build performance requirements, you can easily switch to\nRspack build mode, see Using Rspack for more information.\n\n\nUsing SWC or esbuild#\n\nSWC (Speedy Web Compiler) is a transformer and minimizer for JavaScript and\nTypeScript based on Rust. SWC can provide the same abilities with Babel, and\nit's more than 10x faster than Babel.\n\nesbuild is a front-end build tool based on Golang. It has the functions of\nbundling, compiling and minimizing JavaScript code. Compared with traditional\ntools, the performance is significantly improved. When minimizing code, compared\nto webpack's built-in terser minimizer, esbuild has dozens of times better\nperformance.\n\nBuilder provides SWC plugin and esbuild plugin that allow you to use SWC or\nesbuild instead of babel-loader, ts-loader and terser for transformation and\nminification process. See:\n\n * SWC plugin document\n * esbuild plugin document\n\nSWC vs esbuild\n\nThe SWC compiled outputs has better compatibility, supports polyfills such as\ncore-js, and has more complete features, so it is recommended to use the SWC\nplugin first.\n\n\nAvoid using ts-loader#\n\nBy default, Builder uses Babel to compile TS files. After enabling the\ntools.tsLoader option, ts-loader will be used to compile TS files.\n\nPlease avoid using ts-loader because it requires additional parsing and type\nchecking, which will slow down the build.\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    // remove this config\n    tsLoader: {},\n  },\n};\n\n\nSee the tools.tsLoader documentation for details.\n\n\nDevelopment optimization strategies#\n\nThe following are strategies for improve build performance in development\nenvironment.\n\n\nEnable Lazy Compilation#\n\nYou can enable the lazy compilation (i.e. on-demand compilation) to improve the\ncompilation startup speed.\n\nexport default {\n  experiments: {\n    lazyCompilation: {\n      imports: true,\n      entries: false,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nThis is an experimental feature and may not work correctly in some scenarios,\nsee experiments.lazyCompilation for details.\n\n\nAdjust Source Map format#\n\nIn order to provide a good debugging experience, Builder uses the\ncheap-module-source-map format Source Map by default in the development\nenvironment, which is a high-quality Source Map format and will bring certain\nperformance overhead.\n\nYou can improve build speed by adjusting the source map format of your\ndevelopment environment.\n\nFor example to disable Source Map:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain(chain, { env }) {\n      if (env === 'development') {\n        chain.devtool(false);\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nOr set the source map format of the development environment to the cheapest eval\nformat:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpackChain(chain, { env }) {\n      if (env === 'development') {\n        chain.devtool('eval');\n      }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n> For detailed differences between different Source Map formats, see webpack -\n> devtool.\n\n\nAdjust Browserslist for development#\n\nThis strategy is similar to \"Adjust Browserslist\", the difference is that we can\nset different browserslist for development and production environment, thereby\nreducing the compilation overhead in the development environment.\n\nFor example, you can add the following config to package.json, which means that\nonly the latest browsers are compatible in the development environment, and the\nactual browsers are compatible in the production environment:\n\n{\n  \"browserslist\": {\n    \"production\": [\">0.2%\", \"not dead\", \"not op_mini all\"],\n    \"development\": [\n      \"last 1 chrome version\",\n      \"last 1 firefox version\",\n      \"last 1 safari version\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\n\nNote that this strategy can lead to some differences in the build result of\ndevelopment production environment.\n\n\nProduction optimization strategies#\n\nThe following are strategies for improve build performance in production\nenvironment.\n\n\nDisable Source Map#\n\nIf your project does not need Source Map in the production, you can turn it off\nthrough the disableSourceMap config to improve the build speed.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    disableSourceMap: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\nSee output.disableSourceMap for details.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/optimization/build-performance.mdx","_relativePath":"en/guide/optimization/build-performance.mdx"},{"id":42,"title":"Inline

HTML or JS file, instead of linking to an external file.\nThis can improve the performance of a website by reducing the number of HTTP\nrequests that the browser has to make to load the page.\n\nHowever, static resource inlining also has some disadvantages, such as\nincreasing the size of a single file, which may lead to slower loading.\nTherefore, in the actual scenario, it is necessary to decide whether to use\nstatic resource inlining according to the specific situation.\n\nBuilder will automatically inline static assets that are less than 10KB, but\nsometimes you may need to manually control assets to force them to be inlined or\nnot, and this document explains how to precisely control the inlining behavior\nof static assets.\n\n\nAutomatic Inlining#\n\nBy default, Builder will inline assets when the file size of is less than a\nthreshold (the default is 10KB). When inlined, the asset will be converted to a\nBase64 encoded string and will no longer send a separate HTTP request. When the\nfile size is greater than this threshold, it is loaded as a separate file with a\nseparate HTTP request.\n\nThe threshold can be modified with the output.dataUriLimit config. For example,\nset the threshold of images to 5000 Bytes, and set media assets not to be\ninlined:\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    dataUriLimit: {\n      image: 5000,\n      media: 0,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nForce Inlining#\n\nYou can force an asset to be inlined by adding the inline query when importing\nthe asset, regardless of whether the asset's size is smaller than the size\nthreshold.\n\n\n\n\nexport default function Foo() {\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, the foo.png image will always be inlined, regardless of\nwhether the size of the image is larger than the threshold.\n\nIn addition to the inline query, you can also use the __inline query to force\ninlining of the asset:\n\n\n\n\n\nReferenced from CSS file#\n\nWhen you reference a static asset in your CSS file, you can also force inline\nthe asset with the inline or __inline queries.\n\n.foo {\n  background-image: url('. /icon.png?inline');\n}\n\n\nDo you really need to force inlining?\n\nInline large assets will significantly increase the first paint time or first\ncontentful paint time of a page, which will hurt user experience. And when you\ninline a static asset multiple times into a CSS file, the base64 content will be\nrepeatedly injected, causing the bundle size to grow . Please use forced\ninlining with caution.\n\n\nForce no inlining#\n\nWhen you want to always treat some assets as separate files, no matter how small\nthe asset is, you can add the url query to force the asset not to be inlined.\n\n\n\n\nexport default function Foo() {\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nIn the above example, the foo.png image will always be loaded as a separate\nfile, even if the size of the image is smaller than the threshold.\n\nIn addition to the url query, you can also use the __inline=false query to force\nthe asset not to be inlined:\n\n\n\n\n\nReferenced from CSS file#\n\nWhen you reference a static asset in your CSS file, you can also force the asset\nnot to be inlined with url or __inline=false queries.\n\n.foo {\n  background-image: url('. /icon.png?url');\n}\n\n\nDo you really need to exclude assets from inlining?\n\nExcluding assets from inlining will increase the number of assets that the Web\nApp needs to load. This will reduce the efficiency of loading assets in a weak\nnetwork environment or in scenarios where HTTP2 is not enabled. Please use force\nno Inline with caution.\n\n\nInline JS files#\n\nIn addition to inlining static resource files into JS files, Builder also\nsupports inlining JS files into HTML files.\n\nJust enable the output.enableInlineScripts config, and the generated JS files\nwill not be written into the output directory, but will be directly inlined to\nthe corresponding in the HTML file.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    enableInlineScripts: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nInline CSS files#\n\nYou can also inline CSS files into HTML files.\n\nJust enable the output.enableInlineStyles config, the generated CSS file will\nnot be written into the output directory, but will be directly inlined to the\ncorresponding in the HTML file.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    enableInlineStyles: true,\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nAdd Type Declaration#\n\nWhen you use URL queries such as ?inline and ?url in TypeScript code, TypeScript\nmay prompt that the module is missing a type definition:\n\nTS2307: Cannot find module './logo.png?inline' or its corresponding type declarations.\n\n\nTo fix this, you can add type declarations for these URL queries, please create\nsrc/global.d.ts file and add the following type declarations:\n\ndeclare module '*?inline' {\n  const content: string;\n  export default content;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*?inline' {\n  const content: string;\n  export default content;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*?__inline' {\n  const content: string;\n  export default content;\n}\n\ndeclare module '*?inline=false' {\n  const content: string;\n  export default content;\n}\n","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/optimization/inline-assets.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/optimization/inline-assets.md"},{"id":43,"title":"Bundle Size Optimization","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/optimization/optimize-bundle","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Reduce duplicate dependencies","id":"reduce-duplicate-dependencies","depth":2,"charIndex":234},{"text":"Use lightweight libraries","id":"use-lightweight-libraries","depth":2,"charIndex":1013},{"text":"Adjust Browserslist","id":"adjust-browserslist","depth":2,"charIndex":1579},{"text":"Usage polyfill","id":"usage-polyfill","depth":2,"charIndex":2208},{"text":"Image Compression","id":"image-compression","depth":2,"charIndex":2657},{"text":"Split Chunk","id":"split-chunk","depth":2,"charIndex":3139}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBundle size optimization is an important part in production environment because\nit directly affects the user experience of online users. In this document, we\nwill introduce some common bundle size optimization methods in Builder.\n\n\nReduce duplicate dependencies#\n\nIn real projects, there will be some third-party dependencies installed with\nmultiple versions. Duplicate dependencies can lead to larger bundles and slower\nbuilds.\n\nWe can detect or eliminate duplicate dependencies with some community tools.\n\n * If you are using pnpm >= 7.26.0, you can use the pnpm dedupe command to\n   upgrade and eliminate duplicate dependencies.\n\npnpm dedupe\n\n\n * If you are using pnpm < 7.26.0, you can use pnpm-deduplicate to analyze all\n   duplicate dependencies, then update dependencies or declare pnpm overrides to\n   merge duplicated dependencies.\n\nnpx pnpm-deduplicate --list\n\n\n * If you are using yarn, you can use yarn-deduplicate to automatically merge\n   duplicated dependencies:\n\nnpx yarn-deduplicate && yarn\n\n\n\nUse lightweight libraries#\n\nIt is recommended to using lightweight libraries in your project, such as\nreplacing moment with day.js.\n\nIf you want to find out the large libraries in the project, you can add the\nBUNDLE_ANALYZE=true environment variable when building:\n\nBUNDLE_ANALYZE=true pnpm build\n\n\nAfter adding this parameter, Builder will generate a HTML file that analyzes the\nbundle size, you can manually open the file in the browser and view the detail\nof the bundle size. When an area is larger, it indicates that its corresponding\nbundle size is larger.\n\n\n\n\nAdjust Browserslist#\n\nThe Builder will compile the code according to the project's Browserslist\nconfig, and inject some Polyfills. If the project does not need to be compatible\nwith legacy browsers, you can adjust the Browserslist and drop some legacy\nbrowsers, thereby reducing the compilation overhead on syntax and polyfill.\n\nBuilder's default Browserslist config is:\n\n['> 0.01%', 'not dead', 'not op_mini all'];\n\n\nFor example, if you only need to be compatible with browsers above Chrome 61,\nyou can change it to:\n\n['Chrome >= 61'];\n\n\nTIP\n\nPlease read the Browserslist chapter to know more about the usage of\nBrowserslist.\n\n\nUsage polyfill#\n\nWhen it is clear that third-party dependencies do not require additional\npolyfill, you can set output.polyfill to usage.\n\nIn usage mode, Builder analyzes the syntax used in the source code and injects\nthe required polyfill code on demand to reduce the size of polyfill.\n\nexport default {\n  output: {\n    polyfill: 'usage',\n  },\n};\n\n\nTIP\n\nPlease read the Browser Compatibility chapter to know more about the usage of\nBrowserslist.\n\n\nImage Compression#\n\nIn general front-end projects, the size of image often accounts for a large\nproportion of the total bundle size of the project.So if the image size can be\nreduced as much as possible, it will have a significant optimization effect on\nthe project bundle size.

You can also customize the chunk splitting\nconfig according to your own business scenarios.\n\n\nSplitting Strategies#\n\n> The chunk splitting config of Builder is in performance.chunkSplit.\n\nBuilder supports the following chunk splitting strategies:\n\n * split-by-experience: an empirical splitting strategy, automatically splits\n   some commonly used npm packages into chunks of moderate size.\n * split-by-module: split by NPM package granularity, each NPM package\n   corresponds to a chunk.\n * split-by-size: automatically split according to module size.\n * all-in-one: bundle all codes into one chunk.\n * single-vendor: bundle all NPM packages into a single chunk.\n * custom: custom chunk splitting strategy.\n\n\nsplit-by-experience#\n\nBehavior#\n\nBuilder adopts the split-by-experience strategy by default, which is a strategy\nwe have developed from experience. Specifically, when the following npm packages\nare referenced in your project, they will automatically be split into separate\nchunks:\n\n * lib-polyfill.js: includes core-js, @babel/runtime, @swc/helpers.\n * lib-react.js: includes react, react-dom.\n * lib-router.js: includes react-router, react-router-dom, history,\n   @remix-run/router.\n * lib-lodash.js: includes lodash, lodash-es.\n * lib-antd.js: includes antd.\n * lib-arco.js: includes @arco-design/web-react.\n * lib-semi.js: includes @douyinfe/semi-ui.\n\nThis strategy groups commonly used packages and then splits them into separate\nchunks. Generally, the number of chunks is not large, which is suitable for most\napplications and is also our recommended strategy.\n\nTIP\n\nIf the above npm packages are not installed or used in the project, the\ncorresponding chunk will not be generated.\n\nConfig#\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-experience',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nsplit-by-module#\n\nBehavior#\n\nSplit each NPM package into a Chunk.\n\nWARNING\n\nThis strategy will split the node_modules in the most granular way, and at the\nsame time, under HTTP/2, multiplexing will speed up the loading time of\nresources.However, in non-HTTP/2 environments, it needs to be used with caution\nbecause of HTTP head-of-line blocking problem.\n\nConfig#\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-module',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nall-in-one#\n\nBehavior#\n\nThis strategy puts business code and third-party dependencies in the same Chunk.\n\nConfig#\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'all-in-one',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nsingle-vendor#\n\nBehavior#\n\nThis strategy puts third-party dependencies in one Chunk, and business code in\nanother Chunk.\n\nConfig#\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'single-vendor',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nsplit-by-size#\n\nBehavior#\n\nUnder this strategy, after setting minSize, maxSize to a fixed value, Builder\nwill automatically split them without extra config.\n\nConfig#\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-size',\n      minSize: 30000,\n      maxSize: 50000,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nCustom Splitting Strategy#\n\nIn addition to using the built-in strategies, you can also customize the\nsplitting strategy to meet more customization needs. Custom strategy is divided\ninto two parts:\n\n * Custom group\n * Custom bundler splitChunks config\n\nIt is worth noting that these two custom capabilities can be used together with\nthe built-in strategy, that is, you can use the built-in strategy to split\ncommonly used packages, and then use the custom function to split other\npackages.\n\n\nCustom Group#\n\nBuilder supports custom group, which is more flexible than the built-in\nstrategies, and simpler than writing bundler config.\n\nFor example, split the axios library under node_modules into axios.js:\n\nexport default {\n   performance: {\n     chunkSplit: {\n       strategy: 'split-by-experience',\n       forceSplitting: {\n         axios: /node_modules\\/axios/,\n       },\n     },\n   },\n};\n\n\nThrough forceSplitting config, you can easily split some packages into a Chunk.\n\n\nCustom Bundler splitChunks Config#\n\nIn addition to using custom grouping, you can also customize the native bundler\nconfig through override, such as:\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-experience',\n      override: {\n        chunks: 'all',\n        minSize: 30000,\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe config in override will be merged with the bundler config. For specific\nconfig details, please refer to webpack - splitChunks or Rspack - splitChunks.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/guide/optimization/split-chunk.md","_relativePath":"en/guide/optimization/split-chunk.md"},{"id":45,"title":"Quick Start","routePath":"/builder/en/guide/quick-start","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Environment preparation","id":"environment-preparation","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"Use the Modern.js Framework","id":"use-the-modernjs-framework","depth":2,"charIndex":30},{"text":"Use Builder in a Front-end Framework","id":"use-builder-in-a-front-end-framework","depth":2,"charIndex":737},{"text":"1.

If you encounter any build-related problems\nwhile using the Modern.js framework, you can always refer to the documentation\nof Modern.js Builder to find solutions.\n\n\nUse Builder in a Front-end Framework#\n\nIf you are developing a front-end framework, you can use Builder by following\nthese steps:\n\n\n1. Install Builder#\n\nYou need to install two packages:\n\n * @modern-js/builder is the core package of Builder and exports the core API.\n * @modern-js/builder-webpack-provider is a provider for Builder, providing\n   webpack-based building capabilities.\n\npnpm add @modern-js/builder @modern-js/builder-webpack-provider -D\n\n\n> When upgrading the version, please make sure that Builder and Provider you are\n> installing are the same version.\n\n\n2. Create Builder Instance#\n\nThere are two steps to creating a Builder instance:\n\nFirst you need to initialize the Builder Provider and pass in the builderConfig\nconfig object. Builder provides a lot of configs that allow you to customize the\nbuild behavior. At this point, you don't need to know the specific content of\nthe config, just pass in an empty object. You can find all available configs in\nAPI - config.\n\n\n\n\nconst provider = builderWebpackProvider({\n  builderConfig: {\n    // some configs\n  },\n});\n\n\nAfter getting the provider object, you can call the createBuilder method to\ncreate a Builder instance object:\n\nconst builder = await createBuilder(provider, {\n  entry: {\n    index: './src/index.ts',\n  },\n});\n\n\nExcept the entry option, the createBuilder method also provides some other\noptions, which you can learn more about in API - createBuilder.\n\n\n3. Call Builder Instance Method#\n\nThe Builder instance provides some methods, which you can use it according to\nthe usage scenarios.\n\nTo start local development, it is recommended to use the builder.startDevServer\nmethod, which will start a local Dev Server.\n\nawait builder.startDevServer();\n\n\nAfter successfully starting Dev Server, you can see the following logs:\n\ninfo    Starting dev server...\ninfo    Dev server running at:\n\n  > Local:    http://localhost:8081\n  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8081\n\n\nTo deploy the App to production environment, it is recommended to use the\nbuilder.build method, which will build the production outputs.\n\nawait builder.build();\n\n\n> For more introduction of Builder instance methods, please read the Builder\n> Instance chapter.\n\nAfter completing the above three steps, you have learned the basic usage of\nBuilder.

Developing plugins to change the Builder's\nbehavior and introduce extra features. such as:\n\n * Modify config of bundlers.\n * Resolve and handle new file types.\n * Modify and compile file modules.\n * Deploy your application.\n\nBuilder can use webpack or Rspack as the bundler, expose unified Node.js API,\nand integrate into different frameworks. Users can painlessly switch between\nbundlers.\n\n\nWrite a plugin#\n\nPlugin module should export an entry function just like (options?:\nPluginOptions) => BuilderPlugin, It is recommended to name plugin functions\nbuilderPluginXXX.\n\n\n\nexport interface PluginFooOptions {\n  message?: string;\n}\n\nexport const builderPluginFoo = (\n  options?: PluginFooOptions,\n): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'plugin-foo',\n  setup(api) {\n    api.onExit(() => {\n      const msg = options.message || 'finish.';\n      console.log(msg);\n    });\n  },\n});\n\nbuilder.addPlugins([builderPluginFoo('some other message.')]);\n\n\nThe function usually takes an options object and returns the plugin instance,\nwhich manages state through closures.\n\nLet's look at each part:\n\n * name is used to label the plugin\n * setup as the main entry point of plugins\n * api provides context object, lifetime hooks and utils.\n\nThe package name of the plugin needs to contain the conventional builder-plugin\nprefix for identification, just like builder-plugin-foo,\n@scope/builder-plugin-bar, etc.\n\n\nLifetime Hooks#\n\nBuilder uses lifetime planning work internally, and plugins can also register\nhooks to take part in any stage of the workflow and implement their own\nfeatures.\n\nThe full list of Builder's lifetime hooks can be found in the API References.\n\nThe Builder does not take over the hooks of the underlying bundlers, whose\ndocuments can be found here: webpack hooks\n\n\nUse Builder Config#\n\nCustom plugins can usually get config from function parameters, just define and\nuse it at your pleasure.\n\nBut sometimes you may need to read and change the public config of the Builder.\nTo begin with, you should understand how the Builder generates and uses its\nconfig:\n\n * Read, parse config and merge with default values.\n * Plugins modify the config by api.modifyBuilderConfig(...).\n * Normalize the config and provide it to consume, then the config can no longer\n   be modified.\n\nRefer to this tiny example:\n\nexport const builderPluginUploadDist = (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'plugin-upload-dist',\n  setup(api) {\n    api.modifyBuilderConfig(config => {\n      // try to disable minimize.\n      // should deal with optional value by self.\n      config.output ||= {};\n      config.output.disableMinimize = true;\n      // but also can be enable by other plugins...\n    });\n    api.onBeforeBuild(() => {\n      // use the normalized config.\n      const config = api.getNormalizedConfig();\n      if (!config.output.disableMinimize) {\n        // let it crash when enable minimize.\n        throw new Error(\n          'You must disable minimize to upload readable dist files.',\n        );\n      }\n    });\n    api.onAfterBuild(() => {\n      const config = api.getNormalizedConfig();\n      const distRoot = config.output.distPath.root;\n      // TODO: upload all files in `distRoot`.\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\nThere are 3 ways to use Builder config:\n\n * register callback with api.modifyBuilderConfig(config => {}) to modify\n   config.\n * use api.getBuilderConfig() to get Builder config.\n * use api.getNormalizedConfig() to get finally normalized config.\n\nWhen normalized, it will again merge the config object with the default values\nand make sure the optional properties exist. So for PluginUploadDist, part of\nits type looks like:\n\napi.modifyBuilderConfig((config: BuilderConfig) => {});\napi.getBuilderConfig() as BuilderConfig;\ntype BuilderConfig = {\n  output?: {\n    disableMinimize?: boolean;\n    distPath?: { root?: string };\n  };\n};\n\napi.getNormalizedConfig() as NormalizedConfig;\ntype NormalizedConfig = {\n  output: {\n    disableMinimize: boolean;\n    distPath: { root: string };\n  };\n};\n\n\nThe return value type of getNormalizedConfig() is slightly different from that\nof BuilderConfig and is narrowed compared to the types described elsewhere in\nthe documentation. You don't need to fill in the defaults when you use it.\n\nTherefore, the best way to use configuration items is to\n\n * Modify the config with api.modifyBuilderConfig(config => {})\n * Read api.getNormalizedConfig() as the actual config used by the plugin in the\n   further lifetime.\n\n\nModify webpack Config#\n\nPlugins can handle webpack's config by:\n\n * use api.modifyWebpackChain(chain => {}) to modify webpack-chain.\n * use api.modifyWebpackConfig(config => {}) to modify raw webpack config.\n * use api.onAfterCreateCompiler(compiler => {}) to handle webpack instance\n   directly.\n\nWe recommend that you use neutrinojs/webpack-chain's chained api to handle the\nconfig of webpack whenever possible.\n\nBuilder integrated a webpack5-compatible version, which can be found in\nsorrycc/webpack-chain.\n\n\nExamples#\n\n\nModify Loaders#\n\nThe webpack loaders can be used to load and transform various file types. For\nmore information, see concepts and loaders.\n\n\n\nexport const builderPluginTypeScriptExt = (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-typescript-ext',\n  setup(api) {\n    api.modifyWebpackChain(async chain => {\n      // set ts-loader to recognize more files as typescript modules.\n      chain.module.rule(CHAIN_ID.RULE.TS).test(/\\.(ts|mts|cts|tsx|tss|tsm)$/);\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nAdd Entry Points#\n\n\n\nexport const builderPluginAdminPanel = (): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-admin-panel',\n  setup(api) {\n    api.modifyWebpackChain(async chain => {\n      config.entry('admin-panel').add('src/admin/panel.js');\n    });\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nIntegrate webpack Plugins#\n\nIntegrate existing webpack plugins to migrate your applications:\n\n\n\n\nexport const builderPluginInspector = (options?: Options): BuilderPlugin => ({\n  name: 'builder-plugin-inspector',\n  setup(api) {\n    api.modifyWebpackChain(async chain =>

integrates the Builder's esbuild plugin by default, so\nyou don't need to manually install and register the plugin, just use the\ntools.esbuild configuration:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  tools: {\n    esbuild: {\n      loader: {\n        target: 'chrome61',\n      },\n      minimize: {\n        target: 'chrome61',\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nUse via the Node API#\n\nIf you use the Builder's Node API, you need to manually install and register the\nesbuild plugin.\n\nInstall#\n\nYou can install the plugin with the following command:\n\n# npm\nnpm install @modern-js/builder-plugin-esbuild -D\n\n# yarn\nyarn add @modern-js/builder-plugin-esbuild -D\n\n# pnpm\npnpm add @modern-js/builder-plugin-esbuild -D\n\n\nRegister#\n\nRegister esbuild plugins through the addPlugins method:\n\n\n\n// add the plugin to the builder instance\nbuilder.addPlugins([builderPluginEsbuild()]);\n\n\n\nConfig#\n\nThe plugin will enable code transformation and minification by default.

For a detailed introduction of the target option, please refer to\nesbuild - target.\n\ntarget supports setting to the following environments:\n\n * chrome\n * edge\n * firefox\n * ie\n * ios\n * node\n * opera\n * safari\n\nbuilderPluginEsbuild({\n  loader: {\n    target: 'chrome61',\n  },\n});\n\n\nDisable transformation#\n\nSet loader to false to disable esbuild transformation, and Builder will continue\nto use Babel to transform the code.\n\nbuilderPluginEsbuild({\n  loader: false,\n});\n\n\n\nminimize#\n\n * Type:\n\ntype MinimizeOptions = EsbuildMinifyOptions | false | undefined;\n\n\n * Default:\n\nconst defaultOptions = {\n  css: true,\n  target: 'es2015',\n};\n\n\nThis option is used to enable minification for JavaScript and CSS.\n\nIf you want to modify the options, you can check the esbuild-loader\ndocumentation.\n\nSet the target environment#\n\nUse the target option to set the target environment for minification.\n\nbuilderPluginEsbuild({\n  minimize: {\n    target: 'chrome61',\n  },\n});\n\n\nDisable minification#\n\nSet minimize to false to disable esbuild minification, and Builder will continue\nto use Terser to minify the code.\n\nbuilderPluginEsbuild({\n  minimize: false,\n});\n\n\n\nLimitations#\n\nAlthough esbuild can significantly improve the build performance of existing\nwebpack projects, it still has certain limitations that require special\nattention.\n\n\nCompatibility#\n\nAs a compiler (i.e. loader capability), esbuild usually supports at least ES2015\n(that is, ES6) syntax, and does not have the ability to automatically inject\nPolyfill.. If the production environment needs to downgrade to ES5 and below\nsyntax, it is recommended to use SWC compilation.\n\nYou can specify the target syntax version by following config:\n\nbuilderPluginEsbuild({\n  loader: {\n    target: 'es2015',\n  },\n});\n\n\nAs a code minify tool (i.e. minimize capability), esbuild can minify the code in\nproduction environment, and usually supports ES2015 syntax at least.\n\nIf you set the compressed target to es5, you need to ensure that all codes have\nbeen compiled to ES5 codes, otherwise it will cause esbuild compilation error:\nTransforming 'xxx' to the configured target environment (\"es5\") is not supported\nyet .\n\nTherefore, for projects that need to be compatible with ES5 and below syntax in\nthe production environment, please be careful to enable the minimize capability,\nand it is recommended to use SWC compression.\n\nYou can specify the target syntax version by following config:\n\nbuilderPluginEsbuild({\n  minimize: {\n    target: 'es2015',\n  },\n});\n\n\nCaution\n\nProjects that need to be compatible with ES5 and below syntax in the production\nenvironment need to be careful to turn on the minimize config.\n\n\nNot support Babel plugins#\n\nAs a compiler, the syntax transformation function of the original Babel plugins\nsuch as babel-plugin-import is not available after esbuild is turned on. And\nsince the bottom layer of the plugin uses esbuild's Transform API, it does not\nsupport esbuild plugins to customize the compilation process.\n\nIf you have requirements related to Babel plugins such as babel-plugin-import,\nyou can use the SWC plugin.\n\n\nBundle Size#\n\nAlthough the compression speed of esbuild is faster, the compression ratio of\nesbuild is lower than that of terser, so the bundle size will increase, please\nuse it according to the scenes. Generally speaking, esbuild is more suitable for\nscenes that are not sensitive to bundle size.\n\nYou can refer to minification-benchmarks for a detailed comparison between\nminimizers.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/plugins/plugin-esbuild.mdx","_relativePath":"en/plugins/plugin-esbuild.mdx"},{"id":50,"title":"Image Compress Plugin","routePath":"/builder/en/plugins/plugin-image-compress","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Quick Start","id":"quick-start","depth":2,"charIndex":181},{"text":"Install","id":"install","depth":3,"charIndex":290},{"text":"Register","id":"register","depth":3,"charIndex":543},{"text":"Config","id":"config","depth":2,"charIndex":961}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nWith the image compression plugin, image resources used in the project can be\ncompressed to reduce the size of the product without affecting the visual\nappearance of the image.\n\n\nQuick Start#\n\nTIP\n\nWhen using Rspack as the bundler, the Image Compress plugin is not currently\nsupported.\n\n\nInstall#\n\nYou can install the plugin with the following command:\n\n# npm\nnpm install @modern-js/builder-plugin-image-compress -D\n\n# yarn\nyarn add @modern-js/builder-plugin-image-compress -D\n\n# pnpm\npnpm add @modern-js/builder-plugin-image-compress -D\n\n\n\nRegister#\n\nIn upper-level frameworks such as Modern.js, you can register image compress\nplugins through the builderPlugins config:\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  builderPlugins: [builderPluginImageCompress()],\n};\n\n\nIf you are using the Builder's Node API, you can register image compress plugins\nthrough the addPlugins method:\n\n\n\n// add the plugin to the builder instance\nbuilder.addPlugins([builderPluginImageCompress()]);\n\n\n\nConfig#\n\nThe plugin accepts an array of compressor configuration items, each of which can\nbe either a string or an object.

You can give\nfeedback via issues under the swc-plugins repository and we will evaluate if\nbuilt-in support is needed.\n\n\nBundle Size#\n\nWhen using SWC for code minification instead of terser and cssnano, there may be\na small change in the bundle size. SWC outperforms terser for JavaScript code\ncompression and slightly underperforms cssnano for CSS code compression.\n\nFor a detailed comparison between minifiers, see minification-benchmarks.\n\n\nQuick Start#\n\n\nInstall#\n\nYou can install the plugin with the following command:\n\n# npm\nnpm install @modern-js/builder-plugin-swc -D\n\n# yarn\nyarn add @modern-js/builder-plugin-swc -D\n\n# pnpm\npnpm add @modern-js/builder-plugin-swc -D\n\n\n\nRegister#\n\nIn upper-level frameworks such as Modern.js, you can register SWC plugin through\nthe builderPlugins config:\n\n\n\nexport default {\n  builderPlugins: [builderPluginSwc()],\n};\n\n\nIf you are using the Builder's Node API, you can register SWC plugin through the\naddPlugins method:\n\n\n\n// add the plugin to the builder instance\nbuilder.addPlugins([builderPluginSwc()]);\n\n\nThat's it !\n\nNow you can use SWC transformation and minification in your project.\n\n\nConfig#\n\n * Type:\n\ntype PluginConfig = {\n  presetReact?: ReactConfig;\n  presetEnv?: EnvConfig;\n  jsMinify?: boolean | JsMinifyOptions;\n  cssMinify?: boolean | CssMinifyOptions;\n  extensions?: Extensions;\n};\n\n\n\npresetReact#\n\n * Type: presetReact in SWC.\n\nPorted from @babel/preset-react.

These JavaScript functions will be called by Rust through\nNode-API, which will cause some performance overhead.\n\nSome simple function logic can be replaced by template language. Therefore, the\nconfiguration of function items such as customName, customStyleName can also be\npassed in strings as templates to replace functions and improve performance.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n\nApply following configurations:\n\nPluginSWC({\n  extensions: {\n    pluginImport: [\n      {\n        libraryName: 'foo',\n        customName: 'foo/es/{{ member }}',\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n});\n\n\n{{ member }} will be replaced by the imported specifier:\n\n\n\n\nTemplate customName: 'foo/es/{{ member }}' is the same as customName: (member)\n=> `foo/es/${member}` , but template value has no performance overhead of\nNode-API.\n\nThe template used here is handlebars.

When you enable esbuild in a large project, it can greatly reduce the\ntime required for code compilation and compression, while effectively avoiding\nOOM (heap out of memory) problems.","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/shared/esbuild.md","_relativePath":"en/shared/esbuild.md"},{"id":58,"title":"","routePath":"/builder/en/shared/getBuilderConfig","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"Get the Builder config, this method must be called after the modifyBuilderConfig\nhook is executed.\n\n * Type\n\nfunction GetBuilderConfig(): Readonly;\n","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/shared/getBuilderConfig.md","_relativePath":"en/shared/getBuilderConfig.md"},{"id":59,"title":"","routePath":"/builder/en/shared/getHTMLPaths","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"Get path information for all HTML assets.\n\nThis method will return an object, the key is the entry name and the value is\nthe relative path of the HTML file in the dist directory.\n\n * Type\n\nfunction GetHTMLPaths(): Record;\n","frontmatter":{},"_filepath":"/home/runner/work/modern-js/modern-js/packages/document/builder-doc/docs/en/shared/getHTMLPaths.md","_relativePath":"en/shared/getHTMLPaths.md"},{"id":60,"title":"","routePath":"/builder/en/shared/getNormalizedConfig","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"Get the normalized Builder config, this method must be called after the\nmodifyBuilderConfig hook is executed.\n\nCompared with the api.getBuilderConfig method, the config returned by this\nmethod has been normalized, and the type definition of the config will be\nnarrowed.
