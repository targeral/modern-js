In this way, only part of the code in the project will be\ncompiled, and the dev startup speed will be faster.\n\nFor example, execute modern dev --entry, the entry selector will be displayed in\nthe command line interface:\n\n$ modern dev --entry\n\n? Please select the entry that needs to be built\n❯ ◯ foo\n  ◯ bar\n  ◯ baz\n\n\nFor example, if you select the foo entry, only the code related to the foo entry\nwill be compiled, and the code of other pages will not be compiled.\n\n\nSpecify the page by parameter#\n\nYou can also specify the page name through parameters after --entry, and the\nnames of multiple pages can be separated by commas.\n\n# Compile foo page\nmodern dev --entry foo\n\n# Compile foo and bar pages\nmodern dev --entry foo,bar\n\n\n\nmodern start#\n\nmodern start is an alias of modern dev command, the usage of the two are exactly\nthe same.\n\n\nmodern build#\n\nThe modern build command will build a production-ready product in the dist/\ndirectory by default. You can specify the output directory by modifying the\nconfiguration output.distPath.\n\nUsage: modern build [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -c --config   configuration file path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path\n  -h, --help            show command help\n  --analyze             analyze the bundle and view size of each module\n\n\n\nAnalyze Bundle#\n\nexecute npx modern build --analyze command, can produce an HTML file that\nanalyzes the volume of the bundle while packaging the production code:\n\nBundle Analyzer saved report to /example/dist/report.html\nFile sizes after production build:\n\n  122.35 KB  dist/static/js/885.1d4fbe5a.js\n  2.3 KB     dist/static/js/main.4b8e8d64.js\n  761 B      dist/static/js/runtime-main.edb7cf35.js\n  645 B      dist/static/css/main.0dd3ecc1.css\n\n\nOpen the above HTML file in the browser, you can see the tile diagram of the\npackaged product, and perform package volume analysis and optimization:\n\n> this features based on webpack-bundle-analyzer.\n\n\nmodern new#\n\nThe modern new command is used to enable features in an existing project.\n\nFor example, add application entry, enable some optional features such as\nTailwind CSS, micro frontend, etc.\n\nUsage: modern new [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -d, --debug            using debug mode to log something (default: false)\n  -c, --config   set default generator config(json string)\n  --dist-tag        use specified tag version for its generator\n  --registry             set npm registry url to run npm command\n  -h, --help             show command help\n\n\n\nAdd Entry#\n\nIn the project, execute the new command to add entries as follows:\n\n$ npx modern new\n? Action Create project element\n? Create project element New \"entry\"\n? Entry name entry\n\n\n\nEnable Features#\n\nIn the project, execute the new command to enable features as follows:\n\n$ npx modern new\n? Action Enable features\n? Enable features (Use arrow keys)\n❯ Enable Tailwind CSS\n  Enable BFF\n  Enable SSG\n  Enable Micro Frontend\n  Enable Unit Test / Integration Test\n  Enable Visual Testing (Storybook)\n\n\nTIP\nThe --config parameter needs to use a JSON string.\n\npnpm does not support the use of JSON strings as parameter values currently. Use\nnpm new to turn on.【Relate Issue】\n\n\nmodern serve#\n\nUsually use the modern serve command to enable project run in the production\nenvironment, and you need to execute the `build' command in advance to build the\noutputs.\n\nUsage: modern serve [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -c --config   configuration file path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path\n  -h, --help            show command help\n  --web-only            only run web service\n  --api-only            only run API service\n\n\nBy default, the project will run in localhost:8080, you can modify the Server\nport number with server.port:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    port: 8081,\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nmodern upgrade#\n\nExecute the command npx modern upgrade in the project, by default, dependencies\nin the package.json are updated to the latest version.\n\nUsage: modern upgrade [options]\n\nOptions:\n  --registry   specify npm registry (default: \"\")\n  -d,--debug             using debug mode to log something (default: false)\n  --cwd             app directory (default: \"\")\n  -h, --help             show command help\n\n\n\nmodern inspect#\n\nThe modern inspect command is used to view the Modern.js Builder config and\nwebpack config of the project.\n\nUsage: modern inspect [options]\n\nOptions:\n  --env            view the configuration in the target environment (default: \"development\")\n  --output      Specify the path to output in the dist (default: \"/\")\n  --verbose             Show the full function in the result\n  -c --config   configuration file path, which can be a relative path or an absolute path\n  -h, --help            show command help\n\n\nAfter executing the command npx modern inspect in the project root directory,\nthe following files will be generated in the dist directory of the project:\n\n * builder.config.js: The Modern.js Builder config to use at build time.\n * webpack.config.web.js: The webpack config used by to use at build time.\n\n➜ npx modern inspect\n\nInspect config succeed, open following files to view the content:\n\n  - Builder Config: /root/my-project/dist/builder.config.js\n  - Webpack Config (web): /root/my-project/dist/webpack.config.web.js\n\n\n\nConfiguration Env#\n\nBy default, the inspect command will output the development configs, you can use\nthe --env production option to output the production configs:\n\nmodern inspect --env production\n\n\n\nVerbose content#\n\nBy default, the inspect command will omit the function content in the config\nobject, you can use the --verbose option to output the full content of the\nfunction:\n\nmodern inspect --verbose\n\n\n\nSSR Configuration#\n\nIf the project has enabled SSR, an additional webpack.config.node.js file will\nbe generated in the dist/, corresponding to the webpack configuration at SSR\nbuild time.\n\n➜ npx modern inspect\n\nInspect config succeed, open following files to view the content:\n\n  - Builder Config: /root/my-project/dist/builder.config.js\n  - Webpack Config (web): /root/my-project/dist/webpack.config.web.js\n  - Webpack Config (node): /root/my-project/dist/webpack.config.node.js\n\n\n\nmodern lint#\n\nRun ESLint to check the syntax of the code.\n\nUsage: modern lint [options] [...files]\n\nOptions:\n  --no-fix    disable auto fix source file\n  -h, --help  display help for command\n\n\nNormally, only the part of the code modified by this commit needs to be checked\nby lint-staged during the git commit phase.\n\n * --no-fix close auto fix by lint.\n\n\nmodern test#\n\nmodern test command will automatically run the test cases.\n\nUsage: modern test [options]\n\nOptions:\n  -h, --help  show command help\n\n\nTIP\nmodern test command need to execute the new command in advance to enable the\nunit test/integration test.\n\nThe effect is as follows:\n\n$ npx modern test\n PASS  src/tests/index.test.ts\n  The add method\n    ✓ should work fine.

Fully take over the webpack entry\n\nWhen there is no default export function under src/index.[tj]sx?, this file is\nthe real webpack entry file, and the code can be organized such as\ncreate-react-app:\n\nsrc/index.jsx\n\n\n\n\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n","frontmatter":{"title":"index.[tj]s","sidebar_position":4}},{"id":18,"title":"pages/","routePath":"/en/apis/app/hooks/src/pages","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Dynamic Routing","id":"dynamic-routing","depth":3,"charIndex":1018},{"text":"Global Layout","id":"global-layout","depth":3,"charIndex":1809},{"text":"Partial Layout","id":"partial-layout","depth":3,"charIndex":2607},{"text":"404 路由","id":"404-路由","depth":3,"charIndex":3369}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nEntry identifier if the application want uses file system-based routing.\n\nWhen the entry is the Pages entry type, the files in the pages/ directory will\nbe analyzed to client side routing.\n\nFor example, the following directory:\n\n.\n└── src\n    └── pages\n        ├── about\n        │   └── index.jsx\n        ├── index.jsx\n        └── info.jsx\n\n\nThe generated route is configured as:\n\n[\n  { path: '/', component: 'pages/index.jsx' },\n  { path: '/info' component: 'pages/info.jsx' },\n  { path: '/about', component: 'pages/about/index.jsx' }\n]\n\n\nFiles match the following conditions will not be treated as routing files:\n\n * suffix is not .(j|t)sx?.\n * .d.ts type definition file.\n * test file suffix like .(test|spec|e2e).(j|t)sx?.\n\nTIP\nit is recommended to write only the routing files in the pages/, and write the\nbusiness logic to the independent features directory outside the pages/. In this\nway, most of the files in the pages directory will be routing files, and there\nis no need for additional filtering rules.\n\n\nDynamic Routing#\n\nDirectories or files wrapped with [] are considered dynamic routing.\n\nFor example the following directory structure:\n\n.\n└── src\n    └── pages\n        ├── [post]\n        │   ├── detail.jsx\n        │   └── index.js\n        ├── users\n        │   └── [id].jsx\n        ├── index.jsx\n        └── info.jsx\n\n\nThe generated route is configured as:\n\n[\n  { path: '/', component: 'pages/index.jsx' },\n  { path: '/info', component: 'pages/info.jsx' },\n  { path: '/:post/', component: 'pages/[post]/index.js' },\n  { path: '/:post/detail' components: 'pages/[post]/detail.jsx'},\n  { path: '/users/:id', components: 'pages/users/[id].jsx'}\n]\n\n\nBasis dynamic routing, it supports adding special routing suffixes (*、?、+).\n\nFor example: src/pages/users/[id]*.tsx generate route /users/:id*\n\n\nGlobal Layout#\n\nWhen the entire App needs a global layout, it can be achieved through\npages/_app.tsx, which as follows:\n\n\n\n\nexport const App = ({Component, ...pageProps}:{ Component: React.ComponentType}) => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nThe above Component is the component to which the route is accessed.\n\nFor example the following directory structure:\n\n.\n└── pages\n    ├── a\n    │   ├── b\n    │   │   └── index.js\n    │   └── index.js\n    └── index.js\n\n\n * access /, the Component is pages/index.js.\n * access /a, the Component is pages/a/index.js.\n * access /a/b, the Component is pages/a/b/index.js.\n\nAdvantages\n * preserve the state of the global layout when the page changes.\n * add global css.\n * handle ComponentDidCatch error\n * use defineConfig dynamic configuration runtime.\n\n\nPartial Layout#\n\nWhen developing an App, where sub routes under the same route may share the\nlayout.\n\nFor this scene, Modern.js convention, when there is a _layout.js in the\ndirectory, the routes can shared this layout.\n\nFor example the following directory structure:\n\n└── pages\n    ├── a\n    │   ├── b\n    │   │   └── index.js\n    │   ├── _layout.js\n    │   └── index.js\n    └── index.js\n\n\npages/a/_layout.js\n\n\n\nconst ALayout = ({ Component, ...pageProps }) => {\n  return ;\n};\nexport default ALayout;\n\n\nThe Component props is the specific route, for example\n\n * access /a, the Component is pages/a/index.js.\n * 访问 /a/b, the Component is pages/a/b/index.js.\n\nIn this way, you can use pages/a/_layout.js to display the routing common layout\nin the a directory.\n\n\n404 路由#\n\nThe convention pages/404.[tj]sx is the default 404 route.\n\nFor example the following directory structure:\n\n.\n└── src\n    └── pages\n        ├── user.js\n        ├── home.js\n        ├── 404.js\n\n\nthe generated route is configured is as:\n\n[\n { path: '/user', component: './pages/user.js'},\n { path: '/home', component: './pages/home.js' },\n { path: '*', component: './pages/404.js'}\n]\n\n\nAll unmatched routes will match to pages/404.[tj]s.","frontmatter":{"title":"pages/","sidebar_position":3}},{"id":19,"title":"routes/","routePath":"/en/apis/app/hooks/src/routes","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"basic example","id":"basic-example","depth":2,"charIndex":493},{"text":"Dynamic Route","id":"dynamic-route","depth":2,"charIndex":896},{"text":"Layout component","id":"layout-component","depth":2,"charIndex":1533}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nThe entry identifier when the application uses file system-based routing.\n\nWhen the project structure is of type Routes directory entry, the files in the\nsrc/routes directory are parsed to get the client-side routing configuration.\nSee Routing by convention for more details on usage.\n\nAny layout.[tj]sx and page.[tj]sx under src/routes will be used as a route to\nthe application:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    ├── page.tsx\n    └── user\n        ├── layout.tsx\n        └── page.tsx\n\n\n\nbasic example#\n\nThe directory names in the routes directory will be used as a mapping of the\nroute url, where layout.tsx is used as the layout component and page.tsx as the\ncontent component, which is a leaf node of the whole route, for example the\nfollowing directory structure:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── page.tsx\n    └── user\n        └── page.tsx\n\n\nThe following two routes are produced:\n\n * /\n * /user\n\n\nDynamic Route#\n\nIf the directory name of the route file is named with [], the generated route\nwill be used as a dynamic route.

The way to handle\nthese states is to write the Action functions (pending, fulfilled, rejected).\n\nWith the help of the handleEffect API, we can generate default Action functions\nto handle different results at each stage of an asynchronous request. The\nstructure of the State returned by the Action generated by handleEffect is as\nfollows:\n\ninterface State {\n  result: any; // result of fulfilled state\n  pending: boolean; // request is pending\n  error: string; // request error message\n}\n\n\n\nFunction Signature#\n\ninterface EffectActions {\n  pending: Action;\n  fulfilled: Action;\n  rejected: Action;\n}\n\ninterface Config {\n  ns?: string;\n  result?: string | false;\n  error?: string | false;\n  pending?: string | false;\n  combineMode?: 'merge' | 'replace';\n  omitResultNamespace?: boolean;\n}\n\nfunction handleEffect(config: Config): EffectActions;\n\n\n\nInput#\n\n * ns: the default returned State structure is flat, By setting this parameter,\n   the returned State can be mounted under the field named by the ns.

This parameter corresponds to the\n   field name that stores the fulfilled state results. For example, set result\n   to \"items\", the returned State structure is:\n\ninterface State {\n  items: any; // Default result -> items\n  pending: boolean;\n  error: string;\n}\n\n\nif result is false, then returned State has no result:\n\ninterface State {\n  pending: boolean;\n  error: string;\n}\n\n\n * pending: the default value is \"pending\". Change the name of the pending field\n   in the returned State. Usage is the same as result.\n\n * error: the default value is \"error\". Change the name of the error field in\n   the returned State. Usage is the same as result.\n\n * combineMode: the default value is \"merge\". Get fulfilled state results. There\n   are two ways to deal with it (The data types that can be automatically\n   processed here are also limited to simple object or array types):\n   \n   * \"merge\": the previous data is merged with the current data. the data is an\n     array type, operation is similar to [].concat(lastData, currentData). the\n     data is an object, operation is similar to {...lastData, ...curData}.\n   * \"replace\": the current data directly replaces the previous data.\n\n * omitResultNamespace: the default value is false. When the result is an object\n   type, you want to mount the result directly on the State of the Model, rather\n   than on \"result\", you can set it to true.

The following type definition shows the\nsimplified type information. For the original type, see model.\n\n\nFunction Signature#\n\nfunction useModel(\n  models: Models[],\n  stateSelector?: StateSelector,\n  actionSelector?: ActionSelector,\n): [state, actions, subscribe];\nfunction useModel(\n  ...models: Models[],\n  stateSelector?: (...args: State[]) => any,\n  actionSelector?: (...args: Actions[]) => any,\n): [state, actions, subscribe];\n\n\n\nInput#\n\n * models: Array of Model objects, which can be passed in as an array type\n   parameter, or all Models can be passed in as parameters one by one.\n * stateSelector: Optional parameters, used to filter State calculations. The\n   first n parameters are the States corresponding to n Models, and the returned\n   data is used as the first element of the useModel return value array.\n * actionSelector: Optional parameters, used to filter Action calculations. The\n   first n parameters are the States corresponding to n Models, and the returned\n   data is used as the second element of the useModel return value array.\n\n\nReturn Value#\n\nReturns an array with each value:\n\n * state: return value of stateSelector. if there is no stateSelector, will\n   combine all incoming Model States(including derived states) and return them.\n   If there is an attribute of the same name in the State of different Models,\n   the following State will override the previous State. when state changes, the\n   component call useModel will re-render.\n * actions: return value of actionSelector. if there is no actionSelector, will\n   combine all incoming Model Action(including Effect) and return them. If there\n   is an attribute of the same name in the Action of different Models, the\n   following Action will override the previous Action.\n * subscribe: A function that subscribes to State changes. This function is\n   called when the State of any Model passed in changes.\n\n\nExample#\n\n\nBasic#\n\n\n\n\nfunction Test(props) {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel([todoModel, filterModel]);\n  actions.add(); // call todoModel add action\n  actions.setVisibleStatus(); // call filterModel filterModel action\n\n  state.items; // get todoModel state items\n  state.visibleStatus; // get filterModel state visibleStatus\n}\n\n\n\nSelector Usage#\n\nfunction Test(props) {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(\n    [todoModel, filterModel],\n    (todoState, filterState) => ({\n      items: todoState.items,\n      visibleStatus: `${props.prefix}-${filterState.visibleStatus}`,\n    }),\n    (todoActions, filterActions) => ({\n      ...todoActions,\n      ...filterActions,\n    }),\n  );\n  actions.add(); // call todoModel add action\n  actions.setVisibleStatus(); // call filterModel filterModel action\n\n  state.items; // get todoModel state items\n  state.visibleStatus; // get filterModel state visibleStatus\n}\n\n\nMore\nuse Model.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":2,"title":"useModel"}},{"id":40,"title":"useStaticModel","routePath":"/en/apis/app/runtime/model/use-static-model","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Example","id":"example","depth":2,"charIndex":910}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\ninformation\nBy default, the export package name for all APIs in this section is:\n@modern-js/runtime/model.\n\nIf Reduck is integrated separately from Modern.js, the export package name is:\n@modern-js-reduck/react.\n\nIf want to consume a Model in the form of React Hook in the component, and can\nget the current latest state at any time, but you don't want the Model state to\nbe updated, which will cause the component to be re-rendered, we can use\nuseStaticModel.\n\nuseStaticModel API is same as useModel.For detail, see useModel.\n\nTo ensure that the latest state is always available, be careful not to\ndeconstruct the returned state.\n\nfunction App() {\n  // ❌ Do not deconstruct state, but can deconstruct actions.\n  const [{ username }, { logout }] = useStaticModel(userModel);\n\n  // ✅ True Usage.\n  const [state, { logout }] = useStaticModel(userModel);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    state.username;\n  }, []);\n}\n\n\n\nExample#\n\nThe following App component consumes the userModel state, but does not use it\ndirectly in JSX.

For\nconvention routing, every route in the entry will be rendered.\n\nFor example, the src/ directory has the following file structure that satisfies\nconventional routing:\n\n.\n├── src\n│   └── routes\n│       ├── layout.tsx\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       └── user\n│           ├── layout.tsx\n│           ├── page.tsx\n│           └── profile\n│               └── page.tsx\n\n\nMake the following config in modern.config.[tj]s:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: {\n    ssg: true,\n  },\n});\n\n\nAfter executing pnpm build to build the application. The dist/ directory will\ngenerate three HTML for each of the three routes (only one HTML if SSG not\nenabled), and all HTML has been rendered.\n\nFor example the following self-controlled routing:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst Router = typeof window === 'undefined' ? StaticRouter : BrowserRouter;\n\nexport default () => {\n  const { context } = useRuntimeContext();\n  const pathname = context?.request?.pathname;\n  return (\n    \n      \n        index\n\n} /> about\n} /> ); };\n\nAlso using the above configuration, after executing pnpm run build, only the\nentry route / will generate the rendered HTML.\n\n\nMulti Entries#\n\noutput.ssg can also be configured according to the entries, and the rules that\nthe configuration takes effect are also determined by the entries routing\nmethod.\n\nFor example the following directory structure:\n\n.\n├── src\n│   ├── entryA\n│   │   └── routes\n│   │       ├── layout.tsx\n│   │       ├── page.tsx\n│   │       └── user\n│   │           ├── layout.tsx\n│   │           ├── page.tsx\n│   │           └── profile\n│   │               └── page.tsx\n│   └── entryB\n│       └── App.tsx\n\n\nBy default, all entryA entrances are rendered at build time after setting\noutput.ssg to true. You can configure false to cancel the default behavior of\nthe specified entries. For example, to cancel the rendering of the entryA at\nbuild time:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: {\n    ssg: {\n      entryA: true,\n      entryB: false,\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nConfigure Route#\n\nAs mentioned above, Self-Controlled Routing only enables SSG configuration for\nentries route by default.\n\nSet specific routes in output.ssg can tell Modern.js to enable the SSG of these\nclient side routes. For example, the content of the above src/App.tsx file is:\n\nWhen set like this in modern.config.[jt]s, the /about route will also enable\nSSG:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: {\n    ssg: {\n      routes: ['/', '/about'],\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nModern.js will automatically concat the complete URL according to the entry and\nhand it over to the SSG plugin to complete the rendering.\n\nRequest headers can also be configured for specific entries or routes, for\nexample:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: {\n    ssg: {\n      headers: {},\n      routes: [\n        '/',\n        {\n          url: '/about',\n          headers: {},\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nINFO\nThe headers set in the route override the headers set in the entry.\n\n\nPrevent Default#\n\nBy default, Conventional Routing all turn on SSG. Modern.js provides another\nfield to prevent the default SSG behavior.\n\nFor example, the following directory structure , /、/user and /user/profle all\nhave SSG enabled:\n\n.\n├── src\n│   └── routes\n│       ├── layout.tsx\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       └── user\n│           ├── layout.tsx\n│           ├── page.tsx\n│           └── profile\n│               └── page.tsx\n\n\nYou can set this to disable the default behavior of a client-side route:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: {\n    preventDefault: ['/user'],\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nDynamic Params#\n\nSome routes may be dynamic, such as the /user/:id in a self-controlled route or\nthe route generated by the user/[id]/page.tsx file in a conventional route.\n\nconfigure specific parameters in output.ssg to render the route of the specified\nparameters, for example:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  output: {\n    ssg: {\n      routes: [\n        {\n          url: '/user/:id',\n          params: [\n            {\n              id: 'modernjs',\n            },\n          ],\n        },\n      ],\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nThe features of dynamic routing and SSG is useful when generating static pages\nin real time based on CMS system.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_label":"ssg"}},{"id":120,"title":"output.svgDefaultExport","routePath":"/en/configure/app/output/svg-default-export","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nTIP\nThis config is provided by Modern.js Builder, more detail can see\noutput.svgDefaultExport.\n * Type: url | component\n * Default: url\n\noutput.svgDefaultExport is used to configure the default export type of SVG\nfiles.\n\nWhen output.svgDefaultExport is set to url , the default export of SVG files is\nthe URL of the file.

Specifically, when the following npm packages\nare referenced in your project, they will automatically be split into separate\nchunks:\n\n * lib-polyfill.js: includes core-js, @babel/runtime, @swc/helpers.\n * lib-react.js: includes react, react-dom.\n * lib-router.js: includes react-router, react-router-dom, history,\n   @remix-run/router.\n * lib-lodash.js: includes lodash, lodash-es.\n * lib-antd.js: includes antd.\n * lib-arco.js: includes @arco-design/web-react.\n * lib-semi.js: includes @douyinfe/semi-ui.\n\nTIP\nIf the above npm packages are not installed or used in the project, the\ncorresponding chunk will not be generated.\n\nIf you want to use other splitting strategies, you can specify it via\nperformance.chunkSplit.strategy.\n\nTIP\nThe split-by-module strategy is not supported when using Rspack as the bundler.\n\n\nchunkSplit.minSize#\n\n * Type: number\n * Default: 10000\n\nWhen performance.chunkSplit.strategy is split-by-size, you can specify the\nminimum size of a chunk via performance.chunkSplit.minSize, the unit is bytes.\nThe default value is 10000. For example:\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-size',\n      minSize: 20000,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nchunkSplit.maxSize#\n\n * Type: number\n * Default: Infinity\n\nWhen performance.chunkSplit.strategy is split-by-size, you can specify the\nmaximum size of a chunk via performance.chunkSplit.maxSize, the unit is bytes.\nThe default value is Infinity. For example:\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-size',\n      maxSize: 50000,\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nchunkSplit.forceSplitting#\n\n * Type: RegExp[] | Record\n * Default: []\n\nVia performance.chunkSplit.forceSplitting, you can specify the NPM packages that\nneed to be forced to split.\n\nFor example, split the axios library under node_modules into axios.js:\n\nexport default {\n   performance: {\n     chunkSplit: {\n       strategy: 'split-by-experience',\n       forceSplitting: {\n         axios: /node_modules\\/axios/,\n       },\n     },\n   },\n};\n\n\nThis is an easier way than configuring webpack's splitChunks directly.\n\n\nchunkSplit.splitChunks#\n\nWhen performance.chunkSplit.strategy is custom, you can specify the custom\nwebpack chunk splitting config via performance.chunkSplit.splitChunks. This\nconfig will be merged with the webpack splitChunks config (the cacheGroups\nconfig will also be merged). For example:\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'custom',\n      splitChunks: {\n        cacheGroups: {\n          react: {\n            test: /[\\\\/]node_modules[\\\\/](react|react-dom)[\\\\/]/,\n            name: 'react',\n            chunks: 'all',\n          },\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nchunkSplit.override#\n\nWhen performance.chunkSplit.strategy is split-by-experience, split-by-module,\nsplit-by-size or single-vendor, you can specify the custom webpack chunk\nsplitting config via performance.chunkSplit.override. This config will be merged\nwith the webpack splitChunks config (the cacheGroups config will also be\nmerged). For example:\n\nexport default {\n  performance: {\n    chunkSplit: {\n      strategy: 'split-by-experience',\n      override: {\n        cacheGroups: {\n          react: {\n            test:

Because Modern.js borrowed the design method of Tailwind\nTheme, and also integrates Tailwind CSS internally, the designSystem is used in\nthe same way as Tailwind CSS Theme.\n\n\nStructure#\n\nThe designSystem object contains properties for screens, colors, and spacing, as\nwell as each customizable core plugin.\n\nScreens#\n\nUse screens to customize response breakpoints in your project:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  screens: {\n    sm: '640px',\n    md: '768px',\n    lg: '1024px',\n    xl: '1280px',\n  },\n};\n\n\nWhere the property name in the screens object is the screen name (used as a\nprefix for adaptive utility variants generated by Tailwind CSS, such as\nmd:text-center), and the value is the min-width at which the breakpoint should\nbegin.\n\nDefault breakpoints are inspired by common device resolutions:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  screens: {\n    sm: '640px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }\n\n    md: '768px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 768px) { ... }\n\n    lg: '1024px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }\n\n    xl: '1280px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }\n  },\n};\n\n\nYou can use any name you like as a breakpoint property in your project:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  screens: {\n    tablet: '640px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 640px) { ... }\n\n    laptop: '1024px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 1024px) { ... }\n\n    desktop: '1280px',\n    // => @media (min-width: 1280px) { ... }\n  },\n};\n\n\nThese screen names are reflected in utilities, so text-center now looks like\nthis:\n\n.text-center {\n  text-align: center;\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 640px) {\n  .tablet\\:text-center {\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1024px) {\n  .laptop\\:text-center {\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n}\n\n@media (min-width: 1280px) {\n  .desktop\\:text-center {\n    text-align: center;\n  }\n}\n\n\nMax-width breakpoint#\n\nIf you want to use a max-width breakpoint instead of a min-width, you can\nspecify the screen as an object with a max property:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  screens: {\n    xl: { max: '1279px' },\n    // => @media (max-width: 1279px) { ... }\n\n    lg: { max: '1023px' },\n    // => @media (max-width: 1023px) { ... }\n\n    md: { max: '767px' },\n    // => @media (max-width: 767px) { ... }\n\n    sm: { max: '639px' },\n    // => @media (max-width: 639px) { ... }\n  },\n};\n\n\nIf necessary, to create breakpoints with min-width and max-width definitions,\nfor example:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  screens: {\n    sm: { min: '640px', max: '767px' },\n    md: { min: '768px', max: '1023px' },\n    lg: { min: '1024px', max: '1279px' },\n    xl: { min: '1280px' },\n  },\n};\n\n\nMultiple ranges of breakpoints#\n\nSometimes it is useful to apply a single breakpoint definition to multiple\nscopes.\n\nFor example, let's say you have a sidebar and want the breakpoint to be based on\nthe width of the content area rather than the entire viewport. You can simulate\nthis situation, using a smaller breakpoint style when the sidebar is visible and\nshrinks the content area:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  screens: {\n    sm: '500px',\n    md: [\n      // Sidebar appears at 768px, so revert to `sm:` styles between 768px\n      // and 868px, after which the main content area is wide enough again to\n      // apply the `md:` styles.\n      { min: '668px', max: '767px' },\n      { min: '868px' },\n    ],\n    lg: '1100px',\n    xl: '1400px',\n  },\n};\n\n\nCustom media queries#\n\nIf you need to provide a fully customized media query for the breakpoint, you\ncan use an object with a raw attribute:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  extend: {\n    screens: {\n      portrait: { raw: '(orientation: portrait)' },\n      // => @media (orientation: portrait) { ... }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nPrint Style#\n\nThe raw option can be especially useful if you need to apply a different style\nto the print.\n\nAll you need to do is add a print in designSystem.extend.screens:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  extend: {\n    screens: {\n      print: { raw: 'print' },\n      // => @media print { ... }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nYou can then use a class like print:text-black to specify styles that are only\napplied when someone tries to print a page:\n\n\n  {/* ...  */}\n\n\n\nDark Mode#\n\nThe raw option can be used to implement the \"dark mode\" screen:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  extend: {\n    screens: {\n      dark: { raw: '(prefers-color-scheme: dark)' },\n      // => @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { ... }\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nYou can then style the element differently in dark mode using the dark: prefix:\n\n\n  {/* ...  */}\n\n\n\nNote that since these screen variants are implemented in Tailwind CSS, ** you\ncannot use this method to combine breakpoints with dark modes **, for example\nmd:dark:text-gray-300 will not work.\n\nColors#\n\nThe colors property allows you to customize the global palette of your project.\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  colors: {\n    transparent: 'transparent',\n    black: '#000',\n    white: '#fff',\n    gray: {\n      100: '#f7fafc',\n      // ...\n      900: '#1a202c',\n    },\n\n    // ...\n  },\n};\n\n\nBy default, these colors are inherited by the backgroundColor, textColor, and\nborderColor core plugins.\n\no learn more, see: Customizing Colors.\n\nSpacing#\n\nUsing the space property, you can customize the global spacing and scaling of\nitems:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  spacing: {\n    px: '1px',\n    0: '0',\n    1: '0.25rem',\n    2: '0.5rem',\n    3: '0.75rem',\n    4: '1rem',\n    5: '1.25rem',\n    6: '1.5rem',\n    8: '2rem',\n    10: '2.5rem',\n    12: '3rem',\n    16: '4rem',\n    20: '5rem',\n    24: '6rem',\n    32: '8rem',\n    40: '10rem',\n    48: '12rem',\n    56: '14rem',\n    64: '16rem',\n  },\n};\n\n\nBy default, these values are inherited by the padding, margin, negativeMargin,\nwidth, and height core plugins.\n\nTo learn more, see: Customizing Spacing.\n\nCore plugins#\n\nThe rest of the topic section is used to configure the values available for each\ncore plugin.\n\nFor example, the borderRadius property allows you to customize the utilities of\nthe rounded corners that will be generated:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  borderRadius: {\n    none: '0',\n    sm: '.125rem',\n    default: '.25rem',\n    lg: '.5rem',\n    full: '9999px',\n  },\n};\n\n\n** The property name determines the suffix of the generated class, and the value\ndetermines the value of the actual CSS declaration. ** The example borderRadius\nconfiguration above will generate the following CSS class:\n\n.rounded-none {\n  border-radius: 0;\n}\n.rounded-sm {\n  border-radius: 0.125rem;\n}\n.rounded {\n  border-radius: 0.25rem;\n}\n.rounded-lg {\n  border-radius: 0.5rem;\n}\n.rounded-full {\n  border-radius: 9999px;\n}\n\n\nYou will notice that the rounded class is created without the suffix using the\ndefault property in the theme configuration. This is a common convention in\nTailwind CSS supported by many, though not all, core plugins.\n\nTo learn more about customizing a specific core plugin, visit the plugin's\ndocumentation.\n\n\nCustom default configuration#\n\nOut of the box, your project will automatically inherit values from the default\ntheme configuration. If you want to customize the default theme, you have\nseveral different options depending on the target.\n\nOverride default configuration#\n\nTo override the options in the default configuration, add the properties to\noverride in designSystem:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  // Replaces all of the default `opacity` values\n  opacity: {\n    0: '0',\n    20: '0.2',\n    40: '0.4',\n    60: '0.6',\n    80: '0.8',\n    100: '1',\n  },\n};\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    designSystem,\n  },\n});\n\n\nThis completely replaces the default property configuration, so in the example\nabove, the default opacity utilities is not generated.\n\nAny properties you don't provide will be inherited from the default theme, so in\nthe example above, the default theme configuration for color, spacing, border\nrounded corners, background position, and more will be preserved.\n\nExtension default configuration#\n\nIf you want to keep the default value for the theme option, but want to add a\nnew value, add the extended content in the designSystem.extend property.\n\nFor example, if you want to add an additional breakpoint but keep the existing\none, you can extend the screens property:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  extend: {\n    // Adds a new breakpoint in addition to the default breakpoints\n    screens: {\n      '2xl': '1440px',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    designSystem,\n  },\n});\n\n\nYou can of course override some parts of the default theme and extend other\nparts of the default theme in the same configuration:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  opacity: {\n    0: '0',\n    20: '0.2',\n    40: '0.4',\n    60: '0.6',\n    80: '0.8',\n    100: '1',\n  },\n  extend: {\n    screens: {\n      '2xl': '1440px',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    designSystem,\n  },\n});\n\n\nReference other values#\n\nIf you need to reference another value in the configuration, you can do so by\nproviding a closure function instead of a static value. The function will\nreceive a theme() function as an argument, which you can use to look up other\nvalues in the configuration using dot notation.\n\nFor example, you can generate a fill utility for each color in the palette by\nreferencing theme('colors') on a fill configuration.\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  colors: {\n    // ...\n  },\n  fill: theme => theme('colors'),\n};\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    designSystem,\n  },\n});\n\n\nThe theme() function tries to find the value you're looking for from a fully\nmerged configuration object, so it can reference your own custom settings as\nwell as default theme values. It also works recursively, so as long as there's a\nstatic value at the end of the chain, it can parse the value you're looking for.\n\nReference default configuration\n\nIf you want to reference a value in the default configuration for any reason,\nyou can import it from tailwindcss/defaultTheme. A useful example is if you want\nto add one of the fonts provided by the default configuration:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nconst defaultTheme = require('tailwindcss/defaultTheme');\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  extend: {\n    fontFamily: {\n      sans: ['Lato', ...defaultTheme.fontFamily.sans],\n    },\n  },\n};\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    designSystem,\n  },\n});\n\n\nDisable the entire core plugin#\n\nIf you don't want to generate any classes for a core plugin, it's better to set\nthe plugin to false in the corePlugins configuration instead of providing an\nempty object for this property in the configuration:\n\n// Don't assign an empty object in your theme configuration\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  opacity: {},\n};\n\n// Do disable the plugin in your corePlugins configuration\nconst designSyttem = {\n  corePlugins: {\n    opacity: false,\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe end result is the same, but since many core plugins don't expose any\nconfiguration, they can only be disabled using corePlugins anyway, and it's best\nto keep them consistent.\n\nAdd your own key#\n\nIn many cases, it can be useful to add your own properties to the configuration\nobject.\n\nAn example of this is adding new properties for reuse between multiple core\nplugins. For example, you can extract a positions object that both the\nbackgroundPosition and objectPosition plugins can reference:\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  positions: {\n    bottom: 'bottom',\n    center: 'center',\n    left: 'left',\n    'left-bottom': 'left bottom',\n    'left-top': 'left top',\n    right: 'right',\n    'right-bottom': 'right bottom',\n    'right-top': 'right top',\n    top: 'top',\n  },\n  backgroundPosition: theme => theme('positions'),\n  objectPosition: theme => theme('positions'),\n};\n\n\nAnother example is adding new attributes to a custom plugin for reference. For\nexample, if you wrote a gradual change plugin for a project, you can add a\ngradual change attribute to the subject object referenced by the plugin:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nconst designSystem = {\n  gradients: theme => ({\n    'blue-green': [theme('colors.blue.500'), theme('colors.green.500')],\n    'purple-blue': [theme('colors.purple.500'), theme('colors.blue.500')],\n    // ...\n  }),\n};\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    designSystem,\n  },\n  tools: {\n    tailwind: {\n      plugins: [require('./plugins/gradients')],\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nConfigure reference#\n\nWith the exception of screens, colors, and spacing, all properties in the\nconfiguration object map to the core plugin of Tailwind CSS.

For example, the following usage is wrong:\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    include: [/\\/node_modules\\//],\n  },\n};\n\n\nIf you compile the entire node_modules, not only will the build time be greatly\nincreased, but also unexpected errors may occur.

It is recommended to use tools.webpackChain first.\n\n\nObject Type#\n\nYou can configure it as an object, which will be merged with the original\nwebpack configuration through webpack-merge. For example:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpack: {\n      resolve: {\n        alias: {\n          '@util': 'src/util',\n        },\n      },\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nFunction Type#\n\nYou can also configure it as a function, which accepts one parameter, the\noriginal webpack configuration, you can modify this configuration, and then\nreturn a new configuration. For example:\n\nexport default {\n  tools: {\n    webpack: config => {\n      config.resolve.alias['@util'] = 'src/util';\n      return config;\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe second parameter of this function is an object that contains some\ninformation about the tool collection. Details are as follows:\n\n\nUtils#\n\nenv#\n\n * Type: 'development' | 'production' | 'test'\n\nThe env parameter can be used to determine whether the current environment is\ndevelopment, production or test.

Configuration in modern.config.ts is recommended.\n\nServer runtime configuration can be configured in the\nmodern.server-runtime.config.(ts|js|mjs) file in the root path.\n\n\nConfigure in the configuration file#\n\nModern.js configuration files are defined in the root path of the project, and\nsupports .ts, .js and .mjs formats:\n\n * modern.config.ts\n * modern.config.js\n * modern.config.mjs\n\n\nmodern.config.ts (recommended)#\n\nWe recommend using configuration files in .ts format, which provides friendly\nTypeScript type hints to help you avoid configuration errors.\n\nImport the defineConfig tool function from @modern-js/app-tools, which will help\nyou with configuration type derivation and type completion:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    alias: {\n      '@common': './src/common',\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nmodern.config.js#\n\nIf you are developing a non-TypeScript project, you can use the configuration\nfile in .js format:\n\nmodern.config.js\n\nexport default {\n  source: {\n    alias: opts => {\n      opts['@common'] = './src/common';\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nYou can also dynamically set it with process.env.NODE _ENV:\n\nmodern.config.js\n\nexport default {\n  server: {\n    ssr: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',\n  },\n};\n\n\n\nExport Configuration Function#\n\nModern.js supports exporting a function in the configuration file, and you can\ndynamically compute the configuration in the function and return it to\nModern.js.\n\nmodern.config.js\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig(({ env, command }) => ({\n  source: {\n    alias: {\n      '@foo': env === 'development' ?

If both are used and a configuration conflict occurs,\n   Modern.js will prompt error on the command line.\n * @modern-js/runtime exports the defineConfig API of the same name, please pay\n   attention to the distinction.\n\n\nDebug configuration locally#\n\nTo facilitate local debugging configuration locally, Modern.js supports creating\nmodern.config.local.(ts|js|mjs) files in the root directory of the project to\noverride modern.config.(ts|js|mjs) configurations.\n\n\nExample#\n\nFor example, the port number is configured as 3000 in modern.config.ts:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    port: 3000,\n  },\n});\n\n\nIf you need to change the port number to 3001 to debugging locally, but you\ndon't want to change the modern.config.ts file of the current project, you can\ncreate a modern.config.local.ts file and add the following configuration:\n\nmodern.config.local.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    port: 3001,\n  },\n});\n\n\nThe configuration in the modern.config.local.ts file will be deep merged with\nthe configuration in modern.config.ts and override the configurations in\nmodern.config.ts, so server.port will be is overridden by 3001.\n\n\nNote#\n\nWhen using modern.config.local.ts, please note the following:\n\n * The modern.config.local.ts file is only loaded when running modern dev or\n   modern start commands, and will not be loaded when running modern build.\n * The modern.config.local.ts file overrides not only over modern.config.ts, but\n   also the modernConfig field in package.json.\n * As modern.config.local.ts is only used for local debugging, it is not\n   recommended to commit it to the repository, please ensure that the project's\n   .gitignore file contains modern.config.local.ts.\n\n.gitingore\n\nmodern.config.local.ts\nmodern.config.local.js\nmodern.config.local.mjs\n\n\n\nMerge Multiple Configurations#\n\nIn some cases, you may need to merge multiple configurations into one\nconfiguration. You can use the mergeConfig util to merge multiple\nconfigurations.\n\nThe mergeConfig function accepts an array as a parameter, and each item in the\narray is a configuration object. mergeConfig will deeply merge each\nconfiguration object in the array, automatically merge multiple functions into\nan array, and returns a merged configuration object.\n\n\nExample#\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nconst config1 = {\n   dev: {\n     port: 3000,\n   },\n   tools: {\n     postcss: () => console. log('config1');\n   },\n};\nconst config2 = {\n   dev: {\n     port: 3001,\n   },\n   tools: {\n     postcss: () => console. log('config2');\n   },\n};\n\nconst mergedConfig = mergeConfig([config1, config2]);\n\n\nIn the above example, the merged configuration object is:\n\nconst mergedConfig = {\n  dev: {\n    port: 3001,\n  },\n  tools: {\n    postcss: [() => console.log('config1'), () => console.log('config2')],\n  },\n};\n","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":0}},{"id":187,"title":"Use Proxy","routePath":"/en/guides/advanced-features/bff/bff-proxy","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nBy configuring the BFF proxy, API requests can be forwarded without manual\ncoding\n\nCAUTION\nUsing a BFF proxy ensures that requests can enter the BFF handler.

Take Express as an example to introduce how to write a middleware by hand\nin the api/_ app.ts and add permission verification:\n\n\n\n\nexport default hook(({ addMiddleware }) => {\n  addMiddleware(async (req: Request, res: Response, next: NextFunction) => {\n    if (req.url !== '/api/login') {\n      const sid = req?.cookies?.sid;\n      if (!sid) {\n        res.status(400);\n        res.json({ code: -1, message: 'need login' });\n      } else {\n        next();\n      }\n    } else {\n      next();\n    }\n  });\n});\n\n\nThen add a normal BFF function /api/hello.ts:\n\nexport default async () => {\n  return 'Hello Modern.js';\n};\n\n\nFinally, add the access code of the interface in the front-end src/App.tsx, and\ncall it directly in an integrated way:\n\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function fetchMyApi() {\n      const { message } = await hello();\n      setText(message);\n    }\n\n    fetchMyApi();\n  }, []);\n\n  return \n\n{text};\n};\n\n\nThen exec pnpm run dev starts the project, and accessing http://localhost:8080/\nwill find that the request for'/api/hello 'is blocked:\n\n\n\nFinally, modify the front-end code src/App.tsx to call the login interface\nbefore accessing /api/hello:\n\n\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    async function fetchAfterLogin() {\n      const { code } = await login();\n      if (code === 0) {\n        const { message } = await hello();\n        setText(message);\n      }\n    }\n    fetchAfterLogin();\n  }, []);\n\n  return \n\n{text};\n};\n\n\nRefresh the page and you can see that /api/hello was accessed successfully:\n\n\n\nThe above code simulates the way to add middleware to the /api/_app.ts to\nachieve an easy login function. Also, other functions can be implemented in this\nhook file to extend BFF Server.\n\n\nFramework Writing#\n\nUnder the framework writing, Modern.js does not collect middleware in the\napi/_app.ts, and the running process is controlled by the plugin itself.\n\n\nExpress#\n\nThe framework writing of Express supports defining the startup logic of API\nServer in api/app.[tj]s. performing the initialization work of the application,\nadding global middleware, declaring routes, and even extending the original\nframework.\n\nThe route defined by the BFF function will be registered after the route defined\nby the app.ts file, so here you can also intercept the route defined by the BFF\nfunction, preprocess or respond in advance.\n\napi/app.ts\n\n\n\nconst app = express();\n\napp.put('/user', function (req, res) {\n  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user');\n});\n\napp.use(async (req, res, next) => {\n  console.info(`access url: ${req.url}`);\n  next();\n});\n\nexport default app;\n\n\n\nKoa#\n\nThe Koa framework is written in a similar way to Express. It supports defining\nthe startup logic of API Server in app.[tj]s, performing the initialization work\nof the application, adding global middleware, declaring routes, extending the\noriginal framework, etc.\n\nThe route defined by the BFF function will be registered after the route defined\nby the app.ts file, so here you can also intercept the route defined by the BFF\nfunction, preprocess or respond in advance.\n\nCAUTION\nUse the framework writing, when there is no app.ts, Modern.js will add koa-body\nby default. When there is app.ts, if the developer wants to use the BFF function\nwith Body, he needs to ensure that the koa-body middleware has been added.\napi/app.ts\n\n\n\nconst app = new Koa();\n\napp.put('/user', function (req, res) {\n  res.send('Got a PUT request at /user');\n});\n\napp.use(async (ctx, next) => {\n  console.info(`access url: ${ctx.url}`);\n  await next();\n});\n\nexport default app;\n","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":3,"title":"Frameworks"}},{"id":189,"title":"Basic Usage","routePath":"/en/guides/advanced-features/bff/function","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Enable BFF","id":"enable-bff","depth":2,"charIndex":267},{"text":"BFF Function","id":"bff-function","depth":2,"charIndex":425},{"text":"API Routes","id":"api-routes","depth":2,"charIndex":1396},{"text":"Default Route","id":"default-route","depth":3,"charIndex":1932},{"text":"Multi-layer Route","id":"multi-layer-route","depth":3,"charIndex":2080},{"text":"Dynamic Route","id":"dynamic-route","depth":3,"charIndex":2316},{"text":"Allow List","id":"allow-list","depth":3,"charIndex":2551},{"text":"RESTful API","id":"restful-api","depth":2,"charIndex":2939},{"text":"Function Named Export","id":"function-named-export","depth":3,"charIndex":3685},{"text":"Function Parameter Rule","id":"function-parameter-rule","depth":3,"charIndex":4884},{"text":"Dynamic Path","id":"dynamic-path","depth":4,"charIndex":5193},{"text":"RequestOption","id":"requestoption","depth":4,"charIndex":5848}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nApplications developed with Modern.js can define API functions in the api/\ndirectory, which can be called by the front-end to send requests without writing\nfront and back-end glue layer code, At the same time, it ensures the type safety\nof the front and back end\n\n\nEnable BFF#\n\n 1. Execute pnpm new and select \"Enable BFF\"\n\n 2. Add the following code to modern.config.[tj]s according to the chosen\n    runtime framework:\n\n\nBFF Function#\n\nThe functions that are allowed to be called through integration are called BFF\nfunctions. Here is the simplest BFF function to write, creating an api/hello.ts\nfile:\n\napi/hello.ts\n\nexport const get = async () => 'Hello Modern.js';\n\n\nThen directly import the function in src/App.tsx and call:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\n\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    hello().then(setText);\n  }, []);\n  return \n{text};\n};\n\n\nINFO\nModern.js generator has already configured the @api alias in tsconfig.json, so\nyou can import functions directly by aliases.\n\nThe functions import in src/App.tsx will be automatically converted into\ninterface calls, so there is no need to call the interface through fetch.\n\nExecute pnpm run dev, then open http://localhost:8080/ to see that the page has\ndisplayed the content returned by the BFF function. In Network, you can see that\nthe page sent a request to http://localhost:8080/api/hello.\n\n\n\n\nAPI Routes#\n\nIn Modern.js, the BFF function routing system is implemented based on the file\nsystem, and it is also a conventional routing system.\n\nIn Function Writing, All files under api/ will map to an interface. In Framework\nWriting, All files under api/lambda will map to an interface\n\nNOTE\nFunction Writing & Framework Writing will introduce soon.\n\nAll routes generated by BFF functions have a prefix, and the default value is\n/api. The prefix can be set through bff.prefix.\n\nSeveral routing conventions are described as follow.\n\n\nDefault Route#\n\nFiles named index.[jt]s are mapped to the previous directory.\n\n * api/index.ts -> {prefix}/\n * api/user/index.ts -> {prefix}/user\n\n\nMulti-layer Route#\n\nSupports parsing nested files, if you create a nested folder structure, the\nfiles will still automatically parse routes in the same way.\n\n * api/hello.ts -> {prefix}/hello\n * api/user/list.ts -> {prefix}/user/list\n\n\nDynamic Route#\n\nCreate folders or files named with [xxx] to support dynamic named routing\nparameters.\n\n * api/user/[username]/info.ts -> {prefix}/user/:username/info\n * api/user/username/[action].ts -> {prefix}/user/username/:action\n\n\nAllow List#\n\nBy default, all files in the'api/'directory will be parsed as BFF function\nfiles, but the following files will not be parsed:\n\n * file name start with _, for example _utils.ts.\n * files in directory which name start with _, for example\n   _utils/index.ts、_utils/cp.ts.\n * test files, for example foo.test.ts.\n * type files, for example hello.d.ts.\n * files in node_module.\n\n\nRESTful API#\n\nModern.js BFF functions need to be defined according to the RESTful API\nstandard, follow the HTTP Method specification, and do not allow free parameter\ndefinition.\n\nINFO\nAssuming that the function allows free definition of parameters, the resulting\nroute must be called by the private protocol (the reason is that the request\nparameters cannot be distinguished from the request body), and cannot implement\nany RESTful API.\n\nIf the service is only used for the application itself, there is no problem. but\nits non-standard interface definition cannot be integrated into the larger\nsystem. In the case of multiple systems working together (such as BFF low-code\nconstruction), other systems also need to follow the private protocol.\n\n\nFunction Named Export#\n\nModern.js the export name of the BFF function determines the Method of the\ncorresponding interface of the function, such as get, post and so on.\n\nFor example, following the example, a GET interface can be exported.\n\nexport const get = async () => {\n  return {\n    name: 'Modern.js',\n    desc: 'Web engineering system',\n  };\n};\n\n\nFollowing the example below, a POST interface can be exported.\n\nexport const post = async () => {\n  return {\n    name: 'Modern.js',\n    desc: 'Web engineering system',\n  };\n};\n\n\n * Modern.js supports 9 definitions for HTTP Method:\n   GET、POST、PUT、DELETE、CONNECT、TRACE、PATCH、OPTION、HEAD, can be exported using\n   these methods as functions.\n\n * The name is size insensitive, if GET, can write get、Get、GEt、GET, can be\n   accurately identified. But default export as export default xxx will be map\n   to Get.\n\n * Multiple functions of different Methods can be defined in one file, but if\n   multiple functions of the same Method are defined, only the first will take\n   effect.\n\nINFO\nIt should be noted that the defined functions should all be asynchronous, which\nis related to the type when the function is called, which will be mentioned\nlater.\n\n\nFunction Parameter Rule#\n\nAs mentioned above, in order to meet the design criteria of RESTful APIs, the\nBFF function in Modern.js needs to follow certain imported parameter rules.\n\nThe function parameters are divided into two parts, the dynamic part in the\nrequest path and the request option RequestOption.\n\nDynamic Path#\n\nDynamic routing will be used as imported parameters in the first part of the\nfunction, and each imported parameter corresponds to a dynamic route. For\nexample, in the following example, uid will be passed into the function as the\nfirst two parameters:\n\napi/[level]/[id].ts\n\nexport default async (level: number, id: number) => {\n  const userData = await queryUser(level, uid);\n  return userData;\n};\n\n\nPass dynamic parameters directly when calling:\n\nApp.tsx\n\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const [name, setName] = useState('');\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    getUser(6, 001).then(userData => setName(userData.name));\n  }, []);\n\n  return \n{name};\n};\n\n\nRequestOption#\n\nThe parameter after Dynamic Path is the object RequestOption containing\nquerystring and request body, which is used to define the types of data and\nquery.\n\nIn normal functions without dynamic routing, the incoming data and query can be\nobtained from the first imported parameter, for example:\n\napi/hello.ts\n\n\n\nexport async function post({\n  query,\n  data,\n}: RequestOption, Record>) {\n  // do somethings\n}\n\n\nWhen a function file uses dynamic routing rules, dynamic routing before the\nRequestOption parameter.\n\napi/[sku]/[id]/item.ts\n\nexport async function post(\n  sku: string,\n  id: string,\n  {\n    data,\n    query,\n  }: RequestOption, Record>,\n) {\n  // do somethings\n}\n\n\nAlso pass in the parameters according to the function definition:\n\nApp.tsx\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const addSku = () => {\n    post('0001' /* sku */, '1234' /* id */, {\n      query: {\n        /* ... */\n      },\n      data: {\n        /* ... */\n      },\n    });\n  };\n\n  return \n添加 SKU;\n};\n\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the defined functions should be asynchronous because they\nare automatically converted to HTTP interface calls when called by the front\nend.\n\nso in order to keep the type definition consistent with the actual calling, it\nis necessary to set the BFF function to asynchronous when defining it.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":1,"title":"Basic Usage"}},{"id":190,"title":"BFF","routePath":"/en/guides/advanced-features/bff/","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nIn the development of the concept of front back separation, the front-end part\ncan do more and more things, and the front-end needs some UI-oriented data\ninterfaces, so the industry introduced the concept of BFF (Backends for\nFrontends).\n\nThe main problems it to solve include:\n\n * Aggregation, mapping, clipping, and proxying of lower-level APIs according to\n   their own business needs.\n * Cache data for some specific scenarios to improve performance and thus\n   improve user experience.\n * Quickly development of new products based on existing interfaces.\n * Interface with third-party systems, such as login authentication.\n\nModern.js officially supported the BFF and provided the Integrated BFF to\nfurther strengthen the BFF's capabilities, mainly including the following\ncapabilities:\n\n * Quick development and debugging go live, running, building, and deploying BFF\n   code in the same project.\n * Minimal pure function call, directly import BFF function on the front end,\n   and can be automatically converted into HTTP request when called.\n * No private protocol, follow RESTful API specification, all BFF interfaces are\n   standardized.\n * Full TypeScript support.\n * Meet user preferences and support multi-frame extension writing.","frontmatter":{"title":"BFF"}},{"id":191,"title":"Writing Type","routePath":"/en/guides/advanced-features/bff/type","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Function Writing","id":"function-writing","depth":2,"charIndex":613},{"text":"Framework Writing","id":"framework-writing","depth":2,"charIndex":1120}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nRuntime framework support is also an important part of BFF.

But if the entire rule is\nturned off or changed for these few cases, the gain is not worth the loss.\n\nIn this case, you can use the eslint-disable comment to mark the code blocks\nthat meet the rare case, stating that this is an exception and should be\nignored. For example:\n\n/* eslint-disable filenames/match-exported */\n...\n/* eslint-enable filenames/match-exported */\n\n\nINFO\nEnter eslint in the VS Code editor, a prompt box about eslint-disable will\nautomatically appear, select the prompt option to generate the corresponding\ncomment pair.\n\n[Modern.js ESLint Rule Set] requires that eslint-disable must be used in pairs,\nthe scope to be affected must be clearly expressed, and what rules to disable\nwithin this scope must be clearly expressed, the purpose is to make exceptions\nClear, minimized scope to avoid abuse of eslint-disable, resulting in code that\ndoes not belong to the exception being disabled by the rule.\n\n\nQ: How to customize ESLint rules#\n\n\nThe eslintConfig field in package.json in the root directory#\n\nThis place is the default ESLint configuration for the entire repository and is\ndesigned for pure Node.js code (which can only run in Node.js).\n\nIf the project does have special requirements or inevitable compatibility issues\nwith some rules (not exceptions), you can add rule configuration here. This\nconfiguration will take precedence over the default [Modern.js ESLint ruleset],\nsuch as:\n\n \"eslintConfig\": {\n    \"extends\": [\n      \"@modern-js\"\n    ],\n    \"rules\": {\n      \"filenames/match-exported\": \"off\"\n    }\n  },\n\n\n\n\nsrc/.eslintrc.js#\n\nThe application project and module project of Modern.js will have this\nconfiguration file by default in the source code directory, which is designed\nfor Universal JS code.\n\nINFO\nUniversal JS code is code that can run on both the browser side and the server\nside.\n\nIf the project does have special requirements or inevitable compatibility issues\nwith some rules (not exceptions), you can add a rule configuration here, which\nwill take precedence over the default [Modern.js ESLint ruleset], such as:\n\n// eslint-disable-next-line import/no-commonjs\nmodule.exports = {\n  root: true,\n  extends: ['@modern-js-app'],\n  parserOptions: {\n    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,\n    project: ['../tsconfig.json'],\n  },\n  rules: {\n    'filenames/match-exported': 'off',\n  },\n};\n\n\nIf necessary, you can continue to add the .eslintrc.js file in different\nsubdirectories, and make special configuration for the code in this\nsubdirectory:\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  rules: {\n    'filenames/match-exported': 'off',\n  },\n};\n\n\nTIP\nNote: It is not necessary to use the extends field, it will automatically\ninherit the configuration of the parent directory.\n\n\neslintIgnore field in package.json#\n\nAdding directories that contain .js, .jsx, .ts, .tsx files, but do not require\ncode inspection and automatic repair, to eslintIgnore can optimize the speed of\nESLint inspection, such as:\n\n \"eslintIgnore\": [\n    \"node_modules\",\n    \"dist\",\n    \"output\"\n  ],\n\n\n\nQ: How to upgrade the version of the ESLint plugin#\n\nAs long as it is not a change in the Major version (the \"^\" symbol that does not\ncomply with the Semver rule), you can specify this dependency directly in the\npackage.json of the business project, delete the Lock file (or try to manually\ndelete the Lock file). the contents of this package name in the file), execute\npnpm install to reinstall the dependency and generate a new Lock file.\n\nAfter doing this, the plugin should only exist in the ./node_modules directory\nof the business project and be upgraded to the version you specified.\n\nTIP\n * Major version is the major version number. For more information, please read\n   [Semantic Versioning ].\n * All upstream projects encapsulated by Modern.js (such as ESLint, ESLint\n   plugin, React Router, etc.) can also be upgraded in this way.\n * Modern.js will also try to upgrade these upstream dependencies as timely as\n   possible in each release.\n * Major version upgrades need to be published by Modern.js.\n\n\nQ: WebStorm sometimes reports ESLint errors#\n\nSince WebStorm believes that the ESLint execution directory is determined based\non the .eslintrc' file.

So we can enable SSR in developmenet env, expose\ncode problems in advance and verify SSG rendering effect:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    ssr: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development',\n  }\n}\n\n\nExecute the pnpm run dev command in the project to view the dist/ directory, and\nonly generate an HTML file main/index.html.\n\nExecute the pnpm run build command in the root path of the project. After the\nconstruction is completed, view the dist/ directory, and generate\nmain/index.html, main/user/index.html and main/user/profile/index.html three\nHTML files, the content corresponds to the above three routes.\n\nUsing Conventional Routing, each route will generate a HTML file. Looking at the\nmain/index.html, we can find the text content containing the Index Page, which\nis exactly the effect of SSG.\n\nAfter executing pnpm run serve to start the project, visit the page in the\nNetwork, view the document returned by the request. The document contains the\ncomplete page content rendered by the component.\n\n\nSelf-controlled Routing#\n\nSelf-controlled routing is a custom routing through component code, which\nrequires the application to run to obtain accurate routing information.\nTherefore, the SSG function cannot be used out of the box. At this time, the\nuser needs to inform the Modern.js framework in advance which routes need to\nenable the SSG.\n\nFor example, there is the following code, which contains multiple routes. When\nsetting output.ssg to true, only the entry route '/' will be rendered by\ndefault:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst Router = typeof window === 'undefined' ?

Developers do not need to write\ncomplex server level logic for SSR, nor do they need to care about the operation\nand maintenance of SSR, or create services. Modern.js have a comprehensive SSR\ndegradation strategy to ensure that pages can run safely.\n\nEnabling SSR is very easy, just set 'server.ssr' to true:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  \"server\": {\n    \"ssr\": true,\n  },\n})\n\n\n\nSSR Data Fetch#\n\nModern.js provides Data Loader, which is convenient for developers to fetch data\nunder SSR and CSR. Each routing module, such as layout.tsx and page.tsx, can\ndefine its own Data Loader:\n\nsrc/routes/page.loader.ts\n\nexport default () => {\n  return {\n    message: 'Hello World',\n  };\n};\n\n\nin the component, the data returned by the loader function can be get data\nthrough the Hooks API:\n\nexport default () => {\n  const data = useLoaderData();\n  return \n{data.message};\n};\n\n\nModern.js break the traditional SSR development model and provide users with a\nuser-friendly SSR development experience.\n\nAnd it provides elegant degradation processing. Once the SSR request fails, it\nwill automatically downgrade and restart the request on the browser side.\n\nHowever, developers still need to pay attention to the fallback of data, such as\nnull values or data returns that do not as expect. Avoid React rendering errors\nor messy rendering results when SSR.\n\nINFO\n\n 1. When you request the page on client-side page transitions, Modern.js sends\n    an API request to the server, which runs Data Loader function.\n\n 2. When using Data Loader, data fetching happens before rendering, Modern.js\n    still supports fetching data when the component is rendered. See Data Fetch.\n\n\nKeep Rendering Consistent#\n\nIn some businesses, it is usually necessary to display different UI displays\naccording to the current operating container environment characteristics, such\nas UA information.\n\nIf the processing is not careful enough, the rendering results may do not meet\nthe expectations at this time.\n\nHere is an example to show the problem when SSR and CSR rendering are\ninconsistent, add the following code to the component:\n\n{\n  typeof window !== 'undefined' ? \nbrowser content : null;\n}\n\n\nAfter starting the app, visit the page and will find that the browser console\nthrows a warning message:\n\nWarning: Expected server HTML to contain a matching \n in \n.\n\n\nThis is caused by the inconsistency between the rendering result and the SSR\nrendering result when React executes the hydrate logic on the client side.\nAlthough the page performs normally, in complex applications, it is likely to\ncause problems such as DOM hierarchy confusion and style confusion.\n\nINFO\nFor hydrate logic, please refer to here.\n\nApplications need to maintain the consistency of SSR and CSR rendering results.\nIf there are inconsistencies, it means that this part of the content does not\nneed to be rendered in SSR.\n\nModern.js provide for such content that does not need to be rendered in SSR:\n\n\n\n\nOutside of elements that do not require SSR, wrap with a NoSSR component:\n\n\n  \nclient content\n\n\n\nAfter modifying the code, refresh page found that the previous Waring\ndisappeared. Open the Network window of the browser developer tool to see that\nthe returned HTML document does not contain the content of the NoSSR component\npackage.\n\nINFO\n'useRuntimeContext' can get complete request information, which can be used to\nensure that the rendering results of SSR and CSR are consistent.\n\n\nConcerned Memory Leaks#\n\nWARNING\nIn the SSR, developers need to pay special attention to the problem of memory\nleaks. Even small memory leaks can affect services..\n\nIn SSR, every request triggers the component rendering. So, you need to avoid\ndefining any potentially growing global data, or subscribing to events globally,\nor creating streams that will not be destroyed.\n\nFor example, the following code, when using redux-observable, developers used to\ncode like this:\n\n\n\nconst epicMiddleware = createEpicMiddleware();\nconst rootEpic = combineEpics();\n\nexport default function Test() {\n  epicMiddleware.run(rootEpic);\n  return \nHello Modern.js;\n}\n\n\nCreate a Middleware instance epicMiddleware outside the component and call\nepicMiddleware.run inside the component.\n\nOn the browser side, this code does not cause any problems. But in SSR, the\nMiddleware instance will never be destroyed. Every time the component is\nrendered and rootEpic is called, new event bindings are added internally,\ncausing the entire object to continue to grow larger, which ultimately affects\napplication performance.\n\nSuch problems in CSR are not easy to detect, so when switching from CSR to SSR,\nif you are not sure whether the application has such hidden dangers, you can\npress the application.\n\n\nCrop SSR Data#\n\nIn order to keep the data requested in the SSR phase, it can be used directly on\nthe browser side, Modern.js inject the data and state that collected during the\nrendering process into the HTML.\n\nAs a result, CSR applications often have a large amount of interface data and\nthe state of the components is not crop. If SSR is used directly, the rendered\nHTML size may be too large.\n\nAt this time, SSR not only cannot bring an improvement in the user experience,\nbut may have the opposite effect.\n\nTherefore, when using SSR, developers need to do reasonable weight loss for the\napplication:\n\n 1. Pay attention to the first screen, you can only request the data needed for\n    the first screen in SSR, and render the rest on the browser side.\n 2. Removes the data independent with render from the data returned by the\n    interface.\n\n\nServerless Pre-render#\n\nModern.js provide Serverless Pre-rendering(SPR) to improve SSR performance.\n\nSPR uses pre-rendering and caching to provide the responsive performance of\nstatic Web for SSR pages. It allows SSR applications to have the responsiveness\nand stability of static Web pages, while keeping data dynamically updated.\n\nUsing SPR in the Modern.js is very simple, just add the component, and the page\nwhere the component is located will automatically open SPR.\n\nThis mock a component that uses the useLoaderData API, and the request in the\nData Loader takes 2s.\n\n\n\nexport const loader = async () => {\n  await new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve(null);\n    }, 2000);\n  });\n\n  return {\n    message: 'Hello Modern.js',\n  };\n};\n\nexport default () => {\n  const data = useLoaderData();\n  return \n{data?.message};\n};\n\n\nAfter executing the dev command and opening the page, it is obvious that the\npage needs to wait 2s before returning.\n\nThe next is to use the component, which can be exported directly from\n@modern-js/runtime/ssr :\n\n\n\n\nUse the PreRender component in the routing component and set the parameter\ninterval to indicate that the expiration time of the rendering result is 5s:\n\n\n\n\nAfter modification, execute pnpm run build && pnpm run serve to start the\napplication and open the page.\n\nWhen open page for the first time, it is no different from the previous\nrendering, and there is also a 2s delay.\n\nRefresh page, and the page opens instantly, but at this time, the page data has\nnot changed due to the refresh, because the cache has not expired.\n\nWait 5s, refresh the page again, the data of the page is still unchanged.\nRefresh the page again The data changes, but the page still responds almost\ninstantaneously.\n\nThis is because in the previous request, the SPR has asynchronously obtained the\nnew rendering result in the background, and the page requested this time is the\nversion that has been cached in the server.\n\nIt is conceivable that when interval is set to 1, users can have the responsive\nexperience of a static page.\n\nINFO\nFor more detail, see .\n\n\nTreeshaking#\n\nWhen SSR is enabled, Modern.js will use the same entry to build both the SSR\nBundle and the CSR Bundle. Therefore, the Web API in the SSR Bundle, or the Node\nAPI in the CSR Bundle, can lead to runtime errors.\n\nWeb API into a component is usually to do some global listening, or to get\nbrowser-related data, such as:\n\ndocument.addEventListener('load', () => {\n  console.log('document load');\n});\nconst App = () => {\n  return \nHello World;\n};\nexport default App;\n\n\nThe Node API is introduced in the component file, usually because of the use of\nData Loader, for example:\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const file = fse.readFileSync('./myfile');\n  return {\n    ...\n  };\n};\n\n\n\nUse Environment Variables#\n\nFor the first case, we can directly use Modern.js built-in environment variables\nMODERN_TARGET to remove useless code at build time:\n\nif (process.env.MODERN_TARGET === 'browser') {\n  document.addEventListener('load', () => {\n    console.log('document load');\n  });\n}\n\n\nAfter packaging in the development environment, SSR and CSR artifacts will be\ncompiled into the following content. Therefore, there will be no more errors due\nto Web API in the SSR environment:\n\n// SSR production\nif (false) {\n}\n\n// CSR production\nif (true) {\n  document.addEventListener('load', () => {\n    console.log('document load');\n  });\n}\n\n\nNOTE\nFor more information, see environment variables.\n\n\nUse File Suffix#\n\nHowever, in the second case, for example, when fs-extra is imported into the\ncode, it internally uses the Node API with side effects. If it is directly\nreferenced in the component, it will cause CSR loading errors.\n\nEnv vars is not effective in this situation. Modern.js also supports\ndistinguishing SSR Bundle and CSR Bundle packaging files through files with the\n.node. suffix.\n\nFor example, the import of fs-extra in the code, when it is directly referenced\nto the component, will cause the CSR to load an error. You can create .ts and\n.node.ts files of the same name as a layer of proxy:\n\ncompat.ts\n\nexport const readFileSync: any = () => {};\n\n\ncompat.node.ts\n\nexport { readFileSync } from 'fs-extra';\n\n\nuse ./compat directly into the file. At this time, files with the .node.ts\nsuffix will be used first in the SSR environment, and files with the .ts suffix\nwill be used in the CSR environment.\n\nApp.tsx\n\n\n\nexport const loader = () => {\n  const file = readFileSync('./myfile');\n  return {\n    ...\n  };\n};\n\n\n\nIndependent File#\n\nBoth of the above methods can bring some mental burden to developers. In real\nbusiness scenarios, we found that most of the mixed Node/Web code occurs in data\nrequests.\n\nTherefore, Modern.js developed a Data Fetch to separate CSR and SSR code based\non Nested Routing.\n\nWe can separate data request and component code by using independent files.\nWrite component logic in routes/page.tsx and data request logic in\nroutes/page.loader.ts.\n\nroutes/page.tsx\n\nexport default Page = () => {\n  return \nHello World\n\n}\n\n\nroutes/page.loader.tsx\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const file = fse.readFileSync('./myfile');\n  return {\n    ...\n  };\n}\n\n\n\nRemote Request#\n\nWhen initiating remote requests in SSR, developers sometimes use request tools.\nSome interfaces need to pass user cookies, which developers can get through the\n'useRuntimeContext' API to achieve.\n\nIt should be noted, the request header of the HTML request is obtained, which\nmay not be applicable to remote requests, so must not pass through all request\nheaders.\n\nIn addition, some backend interfaces, or general gateways, will verify according\nto the information in the request header, and full pass-through is prone to\nvarious problems that are difficult to debug. It is recommended that\npass-through on demand.\n\nBe sure to filter the host field if you really need to pass through all request\nheaders.\n\n\nStreaming SSR#\n\nModern.js supports streaming rendering in React 18. Opt in it with the following\nconfiguration:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  \"server\": {\n    \"ssr\": {\n      \"mode\": \"stream\",\n    },\n  },\n})\n\n\nThe streaming SSR of Modern.js is implemented based on React Router, and the\nmain APIs involved are:\n\n * defer: This utility allows you to defer values returned from loaders by\n   passing promises instead of resolved values.\n\n * Await: Used to render deferred values with automatic error handling.\n\n * useAsyncValue: Returns the resolved data from the nearest ancestor component.\n\n\nReturn async data#\n\npage.loader.ts\n\n\n\ninterface User {\n  name: string;\n  age: number;\n}\n\nexport interface Data {\n  data: User;\n}\n\nexport default ({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {\n  const userId = params.id;\n\n  const user = new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        name: `user-${userId}`,\n        age: 18,\n      });\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  return defer({ data: user });\n};\n\n\n\nuser is of Promise type, which means the data will be obtained asynchronously.\nNote that defer must accept an object type parameter, therefore, the parameter\npassed to defer is {data: user}.\n\ndefer can also receive asynchronous data and synchronous data at the same time.\nFor example:\n\npage.loader.ts\n\n\n// skip some codes\n\nexport default ({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {\n  const userId = params.id;\n\n  const user = new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve({\n        name: `user-${userId}`,\n        age: 18,\n      });\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  const otherData = new Promise(resolve => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      resolve('some sync data');\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  return defer({\n    data: user,\n    other: await otherData\n  });\n};\n\n\n\nawait is added before otherData, so the data is obtained synchronously. It can\nbe passed to defer with the data user at the same time.\n\n\nRender async data#\n\nUse the Await component to render the data returned asynchronously from the Data\nLoader. For example:\n\npage.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\nconst Page = () => {\n  const data = useLoaderData() as Data;\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      User info:\n      loading user data ...}>\n        \n          {(user) => {\n            return (\n              \n\n                name: {user.name}, age: {user.age}\n              \n            );\n          }}\n        \n      \n    \n\n); }; export default Page;\n\nAwait needs to be wrapped inside the Suspense component. The resolve of Await\npasses in the data acquired asynchronously by the Data Loader. When the data\nacquisition is completed, the obtained data is rendered through the Render Props\nmode. When the data acquisition is in pending status, the content set by the\nfallback property of the Suspense component will display.\n\nWarning\nWhen importing a type from a Data Loader file, you need to use the import type\nsyntax to ensure that only type information is imported, which can prevent the\nData Loader code from being packaged into the client bundle.\n\nSo, here we `;\n\nYou can also get the asynchronous data returned by Data Loader through\nuseAsyncValue. For example:\n\npage.tsx\n\n\n\n// skip some codes\n\nconst UserInfo = () => {\n  const user = useAsyncValue();\n\n  return (\n     \n\n      name: {user.name}, age: {user.age}\n    \n  )\n}\n\nconst Page = () => {\n  const data = useLoaderData() as Data;\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      User info:\n      loading user data ...}>\n        \n          \n        \n      \n    \n\n); }; export default Page;\n\n\nError handling#\n\nThe errorElement property of the Await component can be used to handle errors\nthrown when the Data Loader executes or when a child component renders. For\nexample, we intentionally throw an error in the Data Loader function:\n\npage.loader.ts\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const data = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      reject(new Error('error occurs'));\n    }, 200);\n  });\n\n  return defer({ data });\n};\n\n\nThen use useAsyncError to get the error, and assign the component used to render\nthe error to the errorElement property of the Await component:\n\npage.ts\n\n\n\n\nexport default function Page() {\n  const data = useLoaderData();\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      Error page\n      loading ...}>\n        }>\n          {(data: any) => {\n            return \nnever displayed;\n          }}\n        \n      \n    \n\n); } function ErrorElement() { const error = useAsyncError() as Error; return\n\nSomething went wrong! {error.message}\n\n; }\nMore\n 1.

In some development scenarios, special server\nlevel logic needs to be customized, such as user authentication, request\npreprocessing, and adding page rendering skeletons.\n\nSome developers may be wondering, Modern.js already provides BFF, why do you\nneed Custom Web Server.\n\nBecause by default, page routing does not go through BFF, it has no way to\nprovide server-side custom logic for page access. The reason for this design is\nthat we do not want the service that controls the page to be bound to the BFF\nservice, so as to avoid the BFF framework restricting how the page is deployed.\n\nFor example, hosting pages separately from BFF, deploying page services to\nnon-Node environments, or customizing for deployment platforms, etc.\n\nFor the above reasons, Modern.js provides three ways that projects can customize\nserver level capabilities progressively according to their needs.\n\nWARNING\nThe three extension methods cannot work at the same time, and developers need to\nchoose the appropriate method according to the scenario.\n\n\nExtending Web Server with API#\n\nThe first way is to customize the server level at a specific life cycle through\nthe server level runtime API provided by Modern.js. The purpose of providing\nthis way is that in some cases, developers do not need to control the full Web\nServer, but only need to add server level logic.\n\nBecause the full web server cannot be controlled this way, and the extension\nlogic only takes effect when the page is requested. Therefore, it is relatively\nsimple to apply to server level logic, and you do not want to create additional\nBFFs or BFFs and pages without common server level logic scenarios.\n\nYou can execute the'pnpm run new 'command in the project root directory to\nenable the \"Custom Web Serve\" function:\n\n? Action Create project element\n? New \"Custom Web Server\" source code directory\n\n\nAfter executing the command, register the @modern-js/plugin-server plugin in\nmodern.config.ts:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [..., serverPlugin()],\n});\n\n\nAfter the function is turned on, the server/index.ts file will be automatically\ncreated in the project directory, and custom logic can be written in this file.\nModern.js provides two types of APIs, Hook and Middleware, to extend Web Server.\n\n\nHook#\n\nThe Hook provided by Modern.js is used to control the built-in logic in the Web\nServer, and all page requests go through the Hook.\n\nThere are currently two Hooks provided, namely AfterMatch and AfterRender, which\ncan be used to modify the rendering results. It can be written in\nserver/index.ts like this:\n\n\n\nexport const afterMatch: AfterMatchHook = (ctx, next) => {\n  next();\n}\n\nexport const afterRender: AfterRenderHook = (ctx, next) => {\n  next();\n}\n\n\nProjects should have the following best practices when using Hook:\n\n 1. Permission verification in afterMatch.\n 2. Do Rewrite and Redirect in afterMatch.\n 3. Do HTML content injection in afterRender.\n\nNOTE\nFor more detail, see Hook.\n\n\nMiddleware#\n\nFor some projects, there may be more requirements at the server level, Modern.js\nprovides Middleware to add pre-middleware for Web Server. It can only run in a\nNode environment, so if the project is deployed to another environment, such as\na Worker environment, Middleware cannot be used.\n\nModern.js provides a set of APIs by default for projects to use:\n\n\n\nexport const middleware: Middlewre = (context, next) => {\n  const { source: { req, res } } = context;\n  console.log(req.url);\n  next();\n};\n\n\nNOTE\nFor more detail, see [Middleware] (/apis/app/runtime/web-server/middleware).\n\nProjects should have the following best practices when using Middleware:\n\n 1. In Middleware, you can directly operate origin request and response objects,\n    do event tracking, and inject Node services (databases, Redis, etc.) that\n    may be used for SSR rendering.\n 2. Marking and crawler optimization can be done in Middleware.\n 3. In Middleware, you can ignore the default rendering and customize the\n    rendering process.\n\nIn general, in CSR projects, using Hook can basically meet all the needs of\nsimple scenarios. In SSR projects, Middleware can be used for more complex Node\nextensions.\n\n\nManaged Page Requests with BFF#\n\nThe second way is to use BFF to Managed page rendering. In this way, all\nrequests will first hit the BFF service.\n\nThis method can uniformly control the server level logic of all requests through\nBFF. Therefore, it is suitable for scenarios where the server level logic is\ncomplex, and BFF and pages need common server level logic. But it still relies\non the Web Server of Modern.js as a whole, and cannot run the logic on existing\nservices.\n\nTo use this method, we need to first enable the \"BFF\" function through pnpm new.\nThen add bff.enableHandleWeb configuration in the configuration file:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  bff: {\n    enableHandleWeb: true,\n  },\n});\n\n\nWhen this value is set to true, page request traffic also goes through the BFF,\nand the logic built into Modern.js for page rendering defaults to running as the\nlast middleware for the BFF service.\n\n\nFully Customized Web Server#\n\nNOTE\nComming soon..","frontmatter":{"title":"Custom Web Server","sidebar_position":3}},{"id":201,"title":"Alias","routePath":"/en/guides/basic-features/alias","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModern.js allow aliases in JS and CSS, and the following aliases are built in:\n\n{\n  '@': '/src',\n  '@shared': '/shared',\n}\n\n\nINFO\nWhen the optional features is enable, the generator will also add built-in\naliases dynamically.

For specific\nusage, please refer to the official website of the corresponding library.\n\n\nUsing Tailwind CSS#\n\nTailwind CSS is a CSS framework and design system based on Utility Class, which\ncan quickly add common styles to components, and support flexible extension of\ntheme styles.

Enable features: Enable Tailwind CSS\n\n\nWhen using, add the following code to the root component of the entry (such as\nsrc/App.jsx):\n\nimport 'tailwindcss/base.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/components.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/utilities.css';\n\n\nYou can then use the Utility Class provided by Tailwind CSS in each component:\n\nconst App = () => (\n  \n\n    \n\nhello world\n  \n);\n\n\nAdditional\nAccording to different needs, you can optionally import the CSS files provided\nby Tailwind CSS. Since the use of @taiwind is equivalent to directly importing\nCSS files, you can refer to the content in the annotate in the @tailwind usage\ndocument for the purpose of the CSS files provided by Tailwind CSS.\n\n\nTailwind CSS version#\n\nModern.js supports both Tailwind CSS v2 and v3. The framework will recognize the\nversion of tailwindcss in the project package.json and apply the corresponding\nconfiguration. By default, we install Tailwind CSS v3 for you.\n\nIf your project is still using Tailwind CSS v2, we recommend that you upgrade to\nv3 to support JIT and other capabilities. For the differences between Tailwind\nCSS v2 and v3 versions, please refer to the following articles:\n\n * Tailwind CSS v3.0\n * Upgrade Guide\n\n\nBrowser Compatibility#\n\nBoth Tailwind CSS v2 and v3 do not support IE 11 browsers.

With\nModern.js' conventional (nested) routing, each routing component (layout.ts or\npage.ts) can have a loader file with the same name that can be executed before\nthe component renders, providing data to the routing component.\n\nINFO\nModern.js v1 supports getting data by useLoader, which is no longer the\nrecommended usage and it is not recommended to mix both except for migration\nprocess.\n\n\nBasic example#\n\nA routing component such as layout.ts or page.ts can define a loader file with\nthe same name. The loader file exports a function that provides the data\nrequired by the component, which is then get data by the useLoaderData function\nin the routing component, as in the following example:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    └── user\n        ├── layout.tsx\n        ├── layout.loader.ts\n        ├── page.tsx\n        └── page.loader.ts\n\n\nDefine the following code in the file:\n\nroutes/user/page.tsx\n\n\n\n\nexport default function UserPage() {\n  const profileData = useLoaderData() as ProfileData;\n  return \n{profileData};\n}\n\n\nroutes/user/page.loader.ts\n\nexport type ProfileData = {\n  /*  some types */\n};\n\nexport default async (): Promise => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api/user/profile');\n  return await res.json();\n};\n\n\nCAUTION\nHere the routing component and the loader file share a type, should use the\nimport type syntax.\n\nIn a CSR environment, the loader function is executed on the client side, and\nthe browser API can be used within the loader function (but it is usually not\nneeded and not recommended).\n\nIn an SSR environment, the loader function will only be executed on the server\nside, regardless of the first screen or the navigation on the client side, where\nany Node.js API can be called, and any dependencies and code used here will not\nbe included in the client bundle.\n\nINFO\nIn later versions, Modern.js may support loader functions running on the server\nside as well in CSR environments to improve performance and security, so here it\nis recommended to keep the loader as pure as possible and only do data fetching\nscenarios.\n\nWhen navigating on the client side, all loader functions under /user and\n/user/profile are executed (requested) in parallel based on Modern.js's\nconventional routing, i.e. when accessing /user/profile, the loader functions\nunder /user and /user/profile are executed (requested) in parallel to improve\nclient-side performance.\n\n\nloader function#\n\nThe loader function has two input parameters:\n\nParams#\n\nWhen a routing file is passed through [], it is passed as a dynamic route and\nthe dynamic route fragment is passed as an argument to the loader function:\n\n// routes/user/[id]/page.loader.tsx\n\n\nexport default async ({ params }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {\n  const { id } = params;\n  const res = await fetch(`https://api/user/${id}`);\n  return res.json();\n};\n\n\nWhen accessing /user/123, the parameters of the loader function are { params: {\nid: '123' } }.\n\nrequest#\n\nrequest is a Fetch Request instance.\n\nA common usage scenario is to obtain query parameters via request:\n\n// routes/user/[id]/page.loader.ts\n\n\nexport default async ({ request }: LoaderFunctionArgs) => {\n  const url = new URL(request.url);\n  const userId = url.searchParams.get('id');\n  return queryUser(userId);\n};\n\n\nReturn value#\n\nThe return value of the loader function can be anything serializable, or it can\nbe a Fetch Response instance:\n\nconst loader = async (): Promise => {\n  return {\n    message: 'hello world',\n  };\n};\nexport default loader;\n\n\nBy default, the response Content-type returned by loader is application/json and\nstatus is 200, which you can set by customizing Response:\n\nconst loader = async (): Promise => {\n  const data = { message: 'hello world' };\n  return new Response(JSON.stringify(data), {\n    status: 200,\n    headers: {\n      'Content-Type': 'application/json; utf-8',\n    },\n  });\n};\n\n\n\nRequest API#\n\nModern.js does a polyfill of the fetch API to initiate requests, which is\nconsistent with the browser's fetch API, but can also be used on the server side\nto initiate requests, meaning that both CSRs and SSRs can use the unified fetch\nAPI for data fetching:\n\nfunction loader() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api/user/profile');\n}\n\n\n\nError handling#\n\nIn the loader function, errors can be handled by throw error or throw response.\nWhen an error is thrown in the loader function, Modern.js will stop executing\nthe code in the current loader and switch the front-end UI to the defined\nErrorBoundary component.\n\n// routes/user/profile/page.loader.tsx\nexport default async function loader() {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api/user/profile');\n  if (!res.ok) {\n    throw res;\n  }\n  return res.json();\n}\n\n// routes/user/profile/error.tsx\n\nconst ErrorBoundary = () => {\n  const error = useRouteError() as Response;\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n\n{error.status}\n      \n\n\n{error.statusText}\n    \n  );\n};\n\nexport default ErrorBoundary;\n\n\n\nGet data from upper level components#\n\nIn many cases, the child component needs to access the data in the ancestor's\nloader, and you can easily access the ancestor's data with useRouteLoaderData:\nuseRouteLoaderData:\n\n// routes/user/profile/page.tsx\n\n\nexport default function UserLayout() {\n  // Get the data returned by the loader in routes/user/layout.loader.ts\n  const data = useRouteLoaderData('user/layout');\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n\n{data.name}\n      \n\n\n{data.age}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nuserRouteLoaderData takes one parameter routeId,When using conventional routing,\nModern.js will automatically generate routeId for you. The value of routeId is\nthe path of the corresponding component relative to src/routes, as in the\nexample above, the child component wants to get the data returned by the loader\nin routes/user/layout.tsx, the value of routeId is user/layout.\n\nIn a multi-entry (MPA) scenario, the value of routeId needs to be added to the\nname of the corresponding entry, and the entry name is usually the entry\ndirectory name if not specified, such as the following directory structure:\n\n.\n└── src\n    ├── entry1\n    │     └── routes\n    │           └── layout.tsx\n    └── entry2\n          └── routes\n                └── layout.tsx\n\n\nIf you want to get the data returned by the loader in entry1/routes/layout.tsx,\nthe value of routeId is entry1_layout.\n\n\n(WIP)Loading UI#\n\nINFO\nThis feature is currently experimental and the API may be adjusted in the\nfuture.Currently, only CSR is supported, so stay tuned for Streaming SSR.\n\nAdd the following code to user/layout.loader.ts:\n\nroutes/user/layout.loader.ts\n\n\n\nconst loader = () =>\ndefer({\n  userInfo: new Promise((resolve) => {\n      setTimeout(() => {\n        resolve({\n          age: 1,\n          name: 'user layout'\n        })\n      }, 1000)\n    })\n  })\n\nexport default loader;\n\n\nAdd the following code to user/layout.tsx:\n\nroutes/user/layout.tsx\n\nimport {\n  Await,\n  defer,\n  useLoaderData,\n  Outlet\n} from '@modern-js/runtime/router';\n\nexport default function UserLayout() {\n  const { userInfo } = useLoaderData() as {userInfo: Promise};\n  return (\n    \n\n      Loading...\n\n}\n      >\n         (\n          \n\n\n            {userInfo.name}\n            {userInfo.age}\n            \n          \n        )}>\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nINFO\nFor specific usage of the Await component, see Await\n\nFor specific usage of the defer function, seedefer\n\n\nWrong usage#\n\n 1. Only serializable data can be returned in loader. In SSR environments, the\n    return value of the loader function is serialized to a JSON string, which is\n    then deserialized to an object on the client side. Therefore, no\n    non-serializable data (such as functions) can be returned in the loader\n    function.\n\nWARNING\nThis restriction is not currently in place under CSR, but we strongly recommend\nthat you follow it, and we may add it under CSR in the future.\n\n// This won't work!\nexport default () => {\n  return {\n    user: {},\n    method: () => {},\n  };\n};\n\n\n 2. Modern.js will call the loader function for you, you shouldn't call it\n    yourself in the component.\n\n// This won't work!\nexport default async () => {\n  const res = fetch('https://api/user/profile');\n  return res.json();\n};\n\n\nexport default function RouteComp() {\n  const data = loader();\n}\n\n\n 3. You cannot import a loader file from a routing component, nor can you import\n    variables in a routing component from a loader file:\n\n// Not allowed\n// routes/layout.tsx\n\n // should use \"import type\" instead\n\nexport const fetch = wrapFetch(fetch);\n\nexport default function UserPage() {\n  const profileData = useLoaderData() as ProfileData;\n  return \n{profileData};\n}\n\n// routes/layout.loader.ts\n // should not be imported from the routing component\nexport type ProfileData = {\n  /*  some types */\n};\n\nexport default async (): Promise => {\n  const res = await fetch('https://api/user/profile');\n  return await res.json();\n};\n\n\n 4. When run on the server side, the loader functions are packaged into a single\n    bundle, so we do not recommend using __filename and __dirname for\n    server-side code.\n\n\nuseLoader(Old)#\n\nuseLoader is an API in Modern.js old version. The API is a React Hook specially\nprovided for SSR applications, allowing developers to fetch data in components.\n\nTIP\nCSR don't need to use useLoader to fetch data.\n\nHere is the simplest example:\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const { data } = useLoader(async () => {\n    console.log('fetch in useLoader');\n\n    // No real request is sent here, just a hard coding data is returned.\n    // In a real project, the data obtained from the remote end should be returned.\n    return {\n      name: 'Modern.js',\n    };\n  });\n\n  return \nHello, {data?.name};\n};\n\n\nAfter the above code starts, visit the page. You can see that the log is printed\nat terminal, but not at console in browser.\n\nThis is because Modern.js server-side rendering, the data returned by the\nuseLoader is collected and injected into the HTML of the response. If SSR\nrendering succeeds, the following code snippet can be seen in the HTML:\n\n\n\n\nIn this global variable, every piece of data is recorded, and this data will be\nused first in the process of rendering on the browser side. If the data does not\nexist, the useLoader function will be re-executed.\n\nNOTE\nDuring the build phase, Modern.js will automatically generate a Loader ID for\neach useLoader and inject it into the JS bundle of SSR and CSR, which is used to\nassociate Loader and data.\n\nCompared with getServerSideProps in the Next.js, get data in advance before\nrendering. Using useLoader, you can get the data required by the local UI in the\ncomponent without passing the data layer by layer. Similarly, it will not add\nredundant logic to the outermost data acquisition function because different\nroutes require different data requests. Of course, useLoader also has some\nproblems, such as the difficulty of Treeshaking server-level code, and the need\nfor one more pre-render at the server level.\n\nModern.js in the new version, a new Loader solution is designed. The new\nsolution solves these problems and can cooperate with nested routing to optimize\npage performance.\n\nNOTE\nDetailed APIs can be found at useLoader.\n\n\nRoute Loader#\n\nNOTE\nStay tuned.","frontmatter":{"title":"Fetch Data","sidebar_position":3}},{"id":204,"title":"Environment Variable","routePath":"/en/guides/basic-features/env-vars","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Built-in Environment Variables","id":"built-in-environment-variables","depth":2,"charIndex":133},{"text":"ASSET_PREFIX","id":"asset_prefix","depth":3,"charIndex":167},{"text":"NODE_ENV","id":"node_env","depth":3,"charIndex":269},{"text":"MODERN_ENV","id":"modern_env","depth":3,"charIndex":641},{"text":"MODERN_TARGET","id":"modern_target","depth":3,"charIndex":869},{"text":"Custom Environment Variables","id":"custom-environment-variables","depth":2,"charIndex":1745},{"text":"Specify via shell","id":"specify-via-shell","depth":3,"charIndex":1854},{"text":"Specify via .env file","id":"specify-via-.env-file","depth":3,"charIndex":1970},{"text":"Using Environment Variables","id":"using-environment-variables","depth":2,"charIndex":2728},{"text":"Convention Names","id":"convention-names","depth":3,"charIndex":2759},{"text":"Any Other Names","id":"any-other-names","depth":3,"charIndex":3236},{"text":"Use Global Replacement","id":"use-global-replacement","depth":2,"charIndex":3788}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModern.js provides support for environment variables, including built-in\nenvironment variables and custom environment variables.\n\n\nBuilt-in Environment Variables#\n\n\nASSET_PREFIX#\n\nThe current path prefix of resource file, which is a read-only environment\nvariable.\n\n\nNODE_ENV#\n\nThe current execution environment and is a read-only environment variable whose\nhave different values under different execution commands:\n\n * production: the default value when exec modern build or modern serve.\n * test: the default value when exec modern test.\n * development: the default value when exec modern dev, alse the default value\n   of other case.\n\n\nMODERN_ENV#\n\nSet the current execution environment manually.

But\nthe values passed in by source.globalVars will be serialized by JSON by default.\nSo it cannot be replaced like 1 + 1 in the example above, at this time, we need\nuse source.define.","frontmatter":{"title":"Environment Variable","sidebar_position":7}},{"id":205,"title":"HTML Template","routePath":"/en/guides/basic-features/html","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"JSX syntax","id":"jsx-syntax","depth":2,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"HTML Component","id":"html-component","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Template Params","id":"template-params","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Examples","id":"examples","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Html Synxtax","id":"html-synxtax","depth":2,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Custom HTML Fragments","id":"custom-html-fragments","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Fully Custom HTML Templates","id":"fully-custom-html-templates","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Template Params","id":"template-params-1","depth":3,"charIndex":-1},{"text":"Config By Entry","id":"config-by-entry","depth":3,"charIndex":-1}],"domain":"","content":"Some Params:\n\n\nentryName: {entryName}\n\n\ntitle: {htmlConfig.title}\n\n\nrootId: {templateParams.mountId}\n\n\nbottom\n\n{/* */}\n\n\nSome Params:\n\n\nentryName: sub\n\n\ntitle:\n\n\nrootId: root\n\n\nbottom\n\n{/* */} {/* */} We're sorry but react app doesn't work properly without\nJavaScript enabled.

environment:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  bff: {\n    proxy: {\n      '/api/v1': 'https://cnodejs.org',\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nFor example, when a BFF call is used in the code, the final request\nhttp://localhost:8080/api/v1/topics will auto proxy to\nhttps://cnodejs.org/api/v1/topics:\n\n\n\ngetTopics();\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Proxy","sidebar_position":5}},{"id":208,"title":"Routes","routePath":"/en/guides/basic-features/routes","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Conventional

for React Router 6 and provides\nvarious types of routing modes. According to different entry types, routing is\ndivided into three modes, namely Conventional routing, Self-controlled routing\nand Other.\n\nNOTE\nThe routes mentioned in this section are client routes, that is, SPA routes.\n\n\nConventional routing#\n\nWith routes/ as the agreed entry, Modern.js will automatically generate the\ncorresponding routing structure based on the file system.\n\nModern.js supports the popular convention routing mode in the industry: nested\nrouting. When using nested routing, the routing of the page corresponds the UI\nstructure, and we will introduce this routing mode in detail.\n\n/user/johnny/profile                  /user/johnny/posts\n+------------------+                  +-----------------+\n| User             |                  | User            |\n| +--------------+ |                  | +-------------+ |\n| | Profile      | |  +------------>  | | Posts       | |\n| |              | |                  | |             | |\n| +--------------+ |                  | +-------------+ |\n+------------------+                  +-----------------+\n\n\n\nRouting file convention#\n\nThere are two file conventions in the routes/ directory layout.[jt]sx and\npage.[jt]sx(abbreviated as .tsx later). These two files determine the layout\nhierarchy of the application, where layout.tsx is used as the layout component,\nand page.tsx is used as the content component, which is the leaf node of the\nentire routing table.\n\nFor example, here routes/layout.tsx will be used as the layout component of all\ncomponents under the / route:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    ├── page.tsx\n    └── user\n        ├── layout.tsx\n        └── page.tsx\n\n\nWhen the route is /, there will be the following UI layout:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nSimilarly, routes/user/layout.tsx will be used as a layout component for all\ncomponents under the /user route. When the route is /user, the following UI\nlayout will be available:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nLayout#\n\ncomponent refers to all layout.tsx files in the routes/ directory, which\nrepresent the layout of the corresponding route segment, and use to represent\nsub-components.\n\nNOTE\nis a new API in React Router 6, see Outlet for details.\n\nIn order to facilitate the introduction of the relationship between and , the\nfollowing file directory example:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── blog\n    │   └── page.tsx\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    ├── page.tsx\n    └── user\n        ├── layout.tsx\n        └── page.tsx\n\n\n 1. When the route is /, in routes/layout.tsx represents the component exported\n    in routes/page.tsx, generating the following UI structure:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n 2. When the route is /blog, in routes/layout.tsx represents the component\n    exported in routes/blog/page.tsx, generating the following UI structure:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n 3. When the route is /user, in routes/layout.tsx represents the component\n    exported in routes/user/layout.tsx. in routes/user/layout.tsx represents the\n    component exported in routes/user/page.tsx. Generate the following UI\n    structure:\n\n\n  \n    \n  \n\n\n\nIn summary, if there is a layout.tsx in the file directory of the subroute, the\nin the previous layout.tsx is the layout.tsx under the file directory of the\nsubroute, otherwise it is the page.tsx under the file directory of the subroute.\n\nPage#\n\nAll routes should end with the component. In the page.tsx file, if the developer\nintroduces the component, it will have no effect.\n\n\nDynamic routing#\n\nWith a file directory named [], the generated route will be used as a dynamic\nroute. For example the following file directory:\n\n└── routes\n    ├── [id]\n    │   └── page.tsx\n    ├── blog\n    │   └── page.tsx\n    └── page.tsx\n\n\nThe routes/[id]/page.tsx file is converted to the /:id route. Except for the\n/blog route that exactly matches, all other /xxx will match this route.\n\nIn component, you can get the corresponding named parameters through useParams.\n\n\nCatch all routing#\n\nIf a $.tsx file is created in the routes directory, this file will act as a\nwildcard route component that will be rendered when there is no matching route.\n\nNOTE\n$.tsx can be thought of as a special page routing component that renders $.tsx\nas a child of layout when there is a layout component in the current directory.\n\nFor example, the following directory structure:\n\n└── routes\n    ├── $.tsx\n    ├── blog\n    │   └── page.tsx\n    └── page.tsx\n\n\nThe routes/$.tsx component is rendered when accessing any path that does not\nmatch, and again, the remainder of the url can be captured in $.tsx using\nuseParams.\n\n$.tsx\n\n\n// When the path is `/aaa/bbb`\nconst params = useParams();\nparams['*']; // => 'aaa/bbb'\n\n\n\nLayout with No Path#\n\nWhen a directory name begins with __, the corresponding directory name is not\nconverted to the actual routing path, such as the following file directory:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── __auth\n    │   ├── layout.tsx\n    │   ├── login\n    │   │   └── page.tsx\n    │   └── signup\n    │       └── page.tsx\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    └── page.tsx\n\n\nModern.js will generate two routes, /login and /sign, __auth/layout.tsx\ncomponent will be used as the layout component of login/page.tsx and\nsignup/page.tsx, but __auth will not be used as the route path fragment.\n\nThis feature is useful when you need to do separate layouts for certain types of\nroutes, or when you want to categorize routes.\n\n\nNo Layout#\n\nIn some cases, the project needs more sophisticated routes, but these routes do\nnot have independent UI layouts. If you create a route like a normal file\ndirectory, the directory level will be deeper.\n\nTherefore Modern.js supports splitting routing fragments by . instead of file\ndirectory. For example, when you need /user/profile/2022/edit, you can directly\ncreate the following file:\n\n└── routes\n    ├── user.profile.[id].edit\n    │      └── page.tsx\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    └── page.tsx\n\n\nWhen accessing a route, you will get the following UI layout:\n\n\n   // routes/user.profile.[id].edit/page.tsx\n\n\n\n\n(WIP)Loading#\n\nIn each layer directory under routes/, developers can create loading.tsx files\nand export a component by default.\n\nWhen the component exists in the routing directory, all routing switches under\nthis level of subrouting will use the component as the Fallback UI when JS Chunk\nis loaded. When the layout.tsx file is not defined in this directory, the\ncomponent will not take effect. For example, the following file directory:\n\n.\n└── routes\n    ├── blog\n    │   ├── [id]\n    │   │   └── page.tsx\n    │   └── page.tsx\n    ├── layout.tsx\n    ├── loading.tsx\n    └── page.tsx\n\n\nWhen a route jumps from / to /blog, if the JS Chunk of the component is not\nloaded, the component UI exported in loading.tsx will be displayed first. But\nwhen jumping from /blog to /blog/20220101, it will not be displayed.\n\n\nRedirect#\n\nYou can redirect routes by creating a data loader file, Suppose you have the\nfile routes/user/page.tsx and you want to redirect the route corresponding to\nthis file, you can create the file routes/user/page.loader.ts:\n\nroutes/user/page.loader.ts\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const user = await getUser();\n  if (!user) {\n    return redirect('/login');\n  }\n  return null;\n};\n\n\n\nErrorBoundary#\n\nIn each layer directory under routes/, the developer can also define a error.tsx\nfile, and export a component by default.\n\nWhen the component exists in a routing directory, the component render error is\ncaught by the ErrorBoundary component. The component does not take effect when\nthe directory does not have a layout.tsx file defined.\n\ncan return the UI view when the error occurred. When the component is not\ndeclared at the current level, the error will bubble up to the higher component\nuntil it is caught or throws an error. At the same time, when a component fails,\nit will only affect the routed component and sub-component that caught the\nerror. The state and view of other components are not affected and can continue\nto interact.\n\nWithin the component, you can use useRouteError to get the specific information\nof the error:\n\n\nexport const ErrorBoundary = () => {\n  const error = useRouteError();\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n\n{error.status}\n      \n\n\n{error.message}\n    \n  );\n};\n\n\n\nHooks before rendering#\n\nIn some scenarios where you need to do some operations before the application\nrenders, you can define init hooks in routes/layout.tsx. init will be executed\non both the client and server side, the basic usage example is as follows:\n\nsrc/routes/layout.tsx\n\n\n\nexport const init = (context: RuntimeContext) => {\n  // do something\n};\n\n\nThe init hook allows you to mount some global data and access the runtimeContext\nvariable from elsewhere in the application:\n\nNOTE\nThis feature is useful when the application requires pre-page data, custom data\ninjection or framework migration (e.g. Next.js)\nsrc/routes/layout.tsx\n\n\n\nexport const init = (context: RuntimeContext) => {\n  return {\n    message: 'Hello World',\n  };\n};\n\n\nsrc/routes/page.tsx\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  const { context } = useRuntimeContext();\n  const { message } = context.getInitData();\n\n  return \n{message};\n};\n\n\nWhen working with SSR, the browser side can get the data returned by init during\nSSR, and the developer can decide whether to retrieve the data on the browser\nside to overwrite the SSR data, for example:\n\nsrc/routes/layout.tsx\n\n\n\nexport const init = (context: RuntimeContext) => {\n  if (process.env.MODERN_TARGET === 'node') {\n    return {\n      message: 'Hello World By Server',\n    };\n  } else {\n    const { context } = runtimeContext;\n    const data = context.getInitData();\n    // If do not get the expected data\n    if (!data.message) {\n      return {\n        message: 'Hello World By Client',\n      };\n    }\n  }\n};\n\n\n\nRuntime Configuration#\n\nIn each root Layout component (routes/layout.ts), the application runtime\nconfiguration can be dynamically defined:\n\nsrc/routes/layout.tsx\n\n\n\nexport const config = (): AppConfig => {\n  return {\n    router: {\n      supportHtml5History: false,\n    },\n  };\n};\n\n\n\nPrefetch#\n\nWhen using convention-based routing, Modern.js will automatically split chunks\naccording to the route, and when the user accesses a specific route, the\ncorresponding resources will be loaded automatically, which can effectively\nreduce the first screen loading time. However, this also brings a problem, when\nthe user accesses a route, if the asset corresponding to that route is not yet\nloaded, a white screen will appear.\n\nIn this case you can show a custom loading component by defining a loading\ncomponent before the static resource is loaded.\n\nTo further improve the user experience and reduce time of loading, Modern.js\nsupports defining the prefetch property on the Link component to load static\nresources and data in advance, with three optional values for the prefetch\nproperty:\n\n\n\n\nINFO\n * This feature is currently only supported in Webpack projects, not in Rspack\n   projects.\n * Prefetching of data will only prefetch the data returned from the data loader\n   of the SSR project.\n\n * none, the default value, will not do prefetch, no additional behavior.\n * intent, the value we recommend for most scenarios, will automatically start\n   loading the corresponding resources and the data defined in the data loader\n   when you mouse over the Link, and will automatically unload it when the mouse\n   is moved away. In our tests, even a direct click can reduce the loading time\n   by about 200ms.\n * render, when the Link component renders, it will load the corresponding\n   resources and the data defined in the data loader.\n\n\nSelf-controlled routing#\n\nWith src/App.tsx as the agreed entry, Modern.js will not do additional\noperations with multiple routes, developers can use the React Router 6 API for\ndevelopment by themselves, for example:\n\nsrc/App.tsx\n\n\n\nexport default () => {\n  return (\n    \n      \n        index\n\n} /> about\n} /> ); };\nNOTE\nModern.js has a series of resource loading and rendering optimizations to the\ndefault convention-based routing, and provides out-of-the-box SSR capabilities,\nwhen using self-directed routing, need to be packaged by the developer, and it\nis recommended that developers use convention-based routing.\n\n\nOther#\n\nBy default, Modern.js turn on the built-in routing scheme, React Router.\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  runtime: {\n    router: true,\n  },\n});\n\n\nModern.js exposes the React Router API from the @modern-js/runtime/router\nnamespace for developers to use, ensuring that developers and Modern.js use the\nsame code. In addition, in this case, the React Router code will be packaged\ninto JS products. If the project already has its own routing scheme, or does not\nneed to use client routing, this feature can be turned off.\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  runtime: {\n    router: false,\n  },\n});\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Routes","sidebar_position":1}},{"id":209,"title":"Builder","routePath":"/en/guides/concept/builder","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Build Architecture","id":"build-architecture","depth":2,"charIndex":314},{"text":"Builder Documentation","id":"builder-documentation","depth":2,"charIndex":558},{"text":"Builder Config","id":"builder-config","depth":2,"charIndex":1019},{"text":"Building Features","id":"building-features","depth":2,"charIndex":1540}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModern.js uses Modern.js Builder to build your Web App.\n\nModern.js Builder is one of the core components of Modern.js.

By default, Modern.js will automatically\ndetermine the entry of the page based on the directory convention, and also\nsupports customizing the entry through configuration items.\n\nMany configuration items provided by Modern.js are divided by entry, such as\npage title, HTML template, page Meta information, whether to enable SSR/SSG,\nserver-side routing rules, etc.\n\n\nSingle Entry and Multiple Entries#\n\nThe project initialized by Modern.js is single-entry (SPA), and the project\nstructure is as follows:\n\n.\n├── src\n│   └── routes\n│       ├── index.css\n│       ├── layout.tsx\n│       └── page.tsx\n├── package.json\n├── modern.config.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n\n\nModern.js can easily switch from single entry to multiple entry. You can execute\npnpm run new under the project to create entry through generator:\n\n? Action: Create project element\n? Create project element: New \"entry\"\n? Entry name: new-entry\n\n\nAfter execution, Modern.js will automatically generate a new entry directory,\nand you can see that the src/ directory has the following structure:\n\n.\n├── myapp     # Original entry\n│   └── routes\n│       ├── index.css\n│       ├── layout.tsx\n│       └── page.tsx\n└── new-entry  # New entry\n    └── routes\n        ├── index.css\n        ├── layout.tsx\n        └── page.tsx\n\n\nThe original code was moved to the directory with the same name as the name in\nthe package.json, and a new directory was created.\n\nAfter executing pnpm run dev, you can see that a /new-entry route has been\nadded, and the migrated code route has not changed.\n\nTIP\nModern.js will use the entry with the same name as the name field in the\npackage.json file as the main entry, the route of the main entry is /, and the\nroute of other entries is /{entryName}.\n\nFor example, when name in package.json is myapp, src/myapp will be used as the\nmain entry of the project.\n\n\nEntry Type#\n\nDifferent entry types have different compile and run-time behaviors. When\ncreating a project in Modern.js, developers can manually choose to create a\nproject in framework mode or build mode. After the creation is complete, you can\nsee that the project template files for different modes are different.\n\nBy default, Modern.js will scan the files under src/ before starting the\nproject, identify the entry, and generate the corresponding server-side route.\n\nTIP\nYou can change the entry directory to another directory through\nsource.entriesDir.\n\nNot all first-level directories under src/ will become project entries, and the\ndirectory where the entry is located must meet one of the following four\nconditions:\n\n 1. Have a routes/ directory\n 2. Has App.[jt]sx? file\n 3. Has index.[jt]sx? file\n 4. Has a pages/ directory (Modern.js 1.0 compatible)\n\nWhen the src/ directory meets the entry characteristics, Modern.js will consider\nthe current project as a single-entry application.\n\nTIP\nIn single-entry applications, the default entry is named main.\n\nWhen the project is not a single-entry application, Modern.js will further check\nthe first-level directory under src/.\n\n\nFramework Mode Entry#\n\nFramework mode refers to the need to use the capabilities of the Modern.js\nframework, such as Router, SSR, integrated calls, etc. Under this kind of entry\nagreement, the entry defined by the developer is not the real Webpack\ncompilation entry. Modern.js will generate an encapsulated entry when it starts,\nand the real entry can be found in node_modules/.modern/{entryName}/index.js.\n\nConventional Routing#\n\nIf there is a routes/ directory in the entry, Modern.js will scan the files\nunder routes/ at startup, and automatically generate client-side routes\n(react-router) based on file conventions.\n\nFor details, please refer to routing.\n\nCustom Routing#\n\nIf there is an App.[jt]sx? file in the entry, the developer can freely set the\nclient route in this file, or not set the client route.\n\nFor details, please refer to routing.\n\nCustom App#\n\nIf there is an index.[jt]sx file in the entry, and when the file exports\nfunctions by default, Modern.js will still generate the code wrapped by\ncreateApp according to the runtime settings. In the rendering process, the\ncomponent wrapped by createApp is passed as a parameter to the function exported\nby the index file, so that developers can customize the component to be mounted\non the DOM node, or add custom behavior before mounting. For example:\n\n\n\n\nexport default (App: React.ComponentType) => {\n  // do something before bootstrap...\n  bootstrap(App, 'root', undefined, ReactDOM);\n};\n\n\nWARNING\nSince the bootstrap function needs to be compatible with React17 and React18,\nyou need to manually pass in ReactDOM parameters when calling the bootstrap\nfunction.\n\nThe content of the file generated by Modern.js is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nconst IS_BROWSER = typeof window !== 'undefined' && window.name !== 'nodejs';\nconst MOUNT_ID = 'root';\n\nlet AppWrapper = null;\n\nfunction render() {\n  AppWrapper = createApp({\n    // plugin parameters for runtime...\n  })(App);\n  if (IS_BROWSER) {\n    customBootstrap(AppWrapper);\n  }\n  return AppWrapper;\n}\n\nAppWrapper = render();\n\nexport default AppWrapper;\n\n\n\nBuild Mode Entry#\n\nBuild mode refers to the ability not to use any Modern.js runtime, and the\ndeveloper defines the entry of the project Webpack completely by himself.\n\nIf index.[jt]sx exists in the entry and there is no default export function,\nthen this file is the real Webpack entry file. This is similar to Create React\nApp, you need to mount components to DOM nodes, add hot update code, etc. For\nexample:\n\nsrc/index.jsx\n\n\n\n\n\nReactDOM.render(, document.getElementById('root'));\n\n\nModern.js not recommended to use this method, this method loses some\ncapabilities of the framework, such as the runtime configuration in the\nmodern.config.js file will no longer take effect. But this method will be very\nuseful when the project is migrated from other frameworks to Modern.js, such as\nCRA, or webpack that is manually built by yourself.\n\n\nCustom Entry#\n\nMost existing projects are not built according to the directory convention of\nModern.js. If you want to change to the directory structure agreed by Modern.js,\nthere will be a certain migration cost.\n\nIn this case, instead of generating the entry using file conventions, you can\nmanually configure the entry in modern.config.[jt]s.\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    entries: {\n      // Specify a new entry named entry_customize\n      entry_customize: './src/home/test/index.ts',\n    },\n    // Disable default ingress scanning\n    disableDefaultEntries: true,\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nDisable Default Entries#\n\nWhen using a custom entry, part of the project structure may happen to hit the\ndirectory convention of Modern.js, but in fact this part of the directory is not\nthe real entry.\n\nModern.js provides disableDefaultEntries config to disable default entry\nscanning rules. When you need to customize the entry, you generally need to use\ndisableDefaultEntries with entries. In this way, some existing projects can be\nquickly migrated without modifying the directory structure.\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  source: {\n    disableDefaultEntries: true,\n  },\n});\n\n\nTIP\nFor detailed usage, please refer to source.entries and\nsource.disableDefaultEntries.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":1}},{"id":211,"title":"Introduction","routePath":"/en/guides/get-started/introduction","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"About Documentation","id":"about-documentation","depth":2,"charIndex":559},{"text":"Modern.js Framework","id":"modern.js-framework","depth":2,"charIndex":1170},{"text":"Next","id":"next","depth":2,"charIndex":3004}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModern.js is an open source web engineering system from ByteDance, which\nprovides multiple solutions to help developers solve problems in different\ndevelopment scenarios.\n\nCurrently, Modern.js includes three solutions, each targeting at different\ndevelopment scenarios: web application development, npm package development, and\ndocument site development:\n\n\n\nAs a part of the Modern.js engineering system, each of these solutions can be\nused separately and has its own independent documentation site. Developers can\nchoose one or more solutions as needed.\n\n\nAbout Documentation#\n\nThis documentation site corresponds to the Modern.js framework, which is used to\ndeveloping web applications.\n\n * If you are developing an npm package, please refer to the Modern.js Module\n   documentation.\n * If you are developing a document site, please refer to the Modern.js Doc\n   documentation.\n * If you want to use the Modern.js's builder engine to implement a web\n   framework, please refer to the Modern.js Builder documentation.\n\nTIP\nAs the Modern.js framework is the most widely used, in this documentation site,\nwe will omit the \"framework\" and simply call it as Modern.js.\n\n\nModern.js Framework#\n\nThe Modern.js framework is a progressive web framework based on React. At\nByteDance, we use Modern.js to build upper-level frameworks that have supported\nthe development of thousands of web applications.\n\nModern.js can provide developers with the ultimate development experience,\nmaking the application get better user experience.\n\nIn the process of developing React applications, developers often need to design\nimplementations for certain functions, or use other libraries and frameworks to\nsolve these problems.\n\nModern.js supports all the configuration and tools required by React\napplications, and has additional features and optimisations built in. Developers\ncan use React to build the UI of the application, and then gradually adopt\nModern.js functions to solve common application requirements, such as routing,\ndata fetching, state management, etc.\n\nIt mainly contains the following features:\n\n * 🚀 Rust Bundler: Easily switch to Rspack bundler with faster build speed.\n * 🪜 Progressive: Create projects with the most streamlined templates,\n   gradually turn on plugin capabilities through generators, and customize\n   solutions.\n * 🏠 Integration: The development is unique to the production environment Web\n   Server, CSR and SSR are isomorphic development, and the function as the API\n   service call.\n * 📦 Out Of The Box: Default TS support, built-in build core, ESLint, debugging\n   tools, full functionality can be tested.\n * 🌏 Ecology: Self-developed state management, micro frontend, module\n   packaging, Monorepo solution and other peripheral requirements.\n * 🕸 Routing Modes: Contains controlled routing, routing based on file\n   conventions (nested routing), configurable routing, etc.\n * 🚀 Independently Build Core: Support a variety of packaging tools, deep\n   optimization bundle.\n\n\nNext#\n\nIf you want to know how to use Modern.js, you can try Create your first app, or\nread Quick Start.","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","sidebar_position":1}},{"id":212,"title":"Quick Start","routePath":"/en/guides/get-started/quick-start","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Environment","id":"environment","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"Node.js","id":"node.js","depth":3,"charIndex":18},{"text":"pnpm","id":"pnpm","depth":3,"charIndex":959},{"text":"Installation","id":"installation","depth":2,"charIndex":1117},{"text":"Initialize","id":"initialize","depth":2,"charIndex":1431},{"text":"Development","id":"development","depth":2,"charIndex":2884},{"text":"Configuration","id":"configuration","depth":2,"charIndex":3228},{"text":"Build","id":"build","depth":2,"charIndex":3753},{"text":"Verify","id":"verify","depth":2,"charIndex":5028},{"text":"Deploy","id":"deploy","depth":2,"charIndex":5401}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\n\nEnvironment#\n\n\nNode.js#\n\nBefore getting started, you will need to install Node.js, and ensure that your\nNode.js version is higher than 14.17.6. We recommend using the LTS version of\nNode.js 16.\n\nYou can check the currently used Node.js version with the following command:\n\nnode -v\n# v16.19.1\n\n\nIf you do not have Node.js installed in your current environment, or the\ninstalled version is lower than 14.17.6, you can use nvm or fnm to install the\nrequired version.\n\nHere is an example of how to install the Node.js 16 LTS version via nvm:\n\n# Install the long-term support version of Node.js 16\nnvm install 16 --lts\n\n# Make the newly installed Node.js 16 as the default version\nnvm alias default 16\n\n# Switch to the newly installed Node.js 16\nnvm use 16\n\n\nnvm and fnm\nBoth nvm and fnm are Node.js version management tools. Relatively speaking, nvm\nis more mature and stable, while fnm is implemented using Rust, which provides\nbetter performance than nvm.\n\n\npnpm#\n\nIt is recommended to use pnpm to manage dependencies:\n\nnpm install -g pnpm@7\n\n\nNOTE\nModern.js also supports dependency management with yarn and npm.\n\n\nInstallation#\n\nModern.js provides the @modern-js/create tool for creating new projects. You can\nuse npx to run it.\n\nYou can create the project in an existing empty directory:\n\nmkdir myapp && cd myapp\nnpx @modern-js/create\n\n\nYou can also directly create the project as a new folder:\n\nnpx @modern-js/create myapp\n\n\n\nInitialize#\n\nModern.js generator will provide an interactive Q & A interface, initialization\nitems according to the result, according to the default selection:\n\n? Please select the solution you want to create: Web App\n? Development Language: TS\n? Package Manager: pnpm\n\n\nAfter create the project, Modern.js automatically installs dependency and\ncreates a git repository.\n\n[INFO] dependencies are automatically installed\n[INFO] git repository has been automatically created\n[INFO] Success！\nYou can run the following command in the directory of the new project:\npnpm run dev          # Run and debug the project according to the requirements of the development environment\npnpm run build        # Build the project according to the requirements of the product environment\npnpm run serve        # Run the project according to the requirements of the product environment\npnpm run lint         # Check and fix all codes\npnpm run new          # Create more project elements, such as application portals\n\n\nNOTE\nIn addition to working during project initialization, the Modern.js generator\ncan also generate modules of the project in subsequent development, which is not\nthrown away as soon as it is used.\n\nNow, the project structure is as follows:\n\n.\n├── src\n│   ├── modern-app-env.d.ts\n│   └── routes\n│       ├── index.css\n│       ├── layout.tsx\n│       └── page.tsx\n├── modern.config.ts\n├── package.json\n├── pnpm-lock.yaml\n├── README.md\n└── tsconfig.json\n\n\n\nDevelopment#\n\nExecute pnpm run dev in the project to start the project:\n\n$ pnpm run dev\n\n> modern dev\n\ninfo    Starting dev server...\ninfo    App running at:\n\n  > Local:    http://localhost:8080/\n  > Network:  http://192.168.0.1:8080/\n\n Client ✔ done in 76.10ms\n\n\nOpen http://localhost:8000/ in your browser and you will see the following:\n\n\n\n\nConfiguration#\n\nThe modern.config.ts files exist in Modern.js projects created by the generator.\n\nFeatures can be enabled through the configuration file, or the default behavior\nof the coverage Modern.js.

message = createWaterfall();\n\n\nthen register:\n\nconfig/plugin/myPlugin.ts\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  registerHook: {\n    message,\n  },\n});\n\n\nadd Hook types:\n\nconfig/plugin/myPlugin.ts\n\ndeclare module '@modern-js/core' {\n  export interface Hooks {\n    message: typeof message;\n  }\n}\n\n\n\nUsing Hooks#\n\nCreate a plugin and add command handling logic through the commands Hook\nfunction:\n\nconfig/plugin/myPlugin.ts\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup(api) {\n    return {\n      commands({ program }) {\n        program.command('message').action(async () => {\n          const hookRunners = api.useHookRunners();\n          const messages = hookRunners.message([]);\n          console.log(messages.join('\\n'));\n        });\n      },\n    };\n  },\n});\n\n\nnow config/plugin/myPlugin.ts is:\n\nconfig/plugin/myPlugin.ts\n\n\n\n\nconst message = createWaterfall();\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  registerHook: {\n    message,\n  },\n\n  setup(api) {\n    return {\n      commands({ program }) {\n

plugin in modern.config.ts:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [myPlugin()],\n});\n\n\nNow, run npx modern message, and the related logic will be executed, but no\ninformation is collected, so the console output is empty.\n\nadd:\n\nconfig/plugin/otherPlugin.ts\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'other-plugin',\n\n  setup(api) {\n    return

Let's take a look at a simple example:\n\n\n\n// 1. create\nconst pipeline = createPipeline();\n\n// 2. add function\npipeline.use((count, next) => {\n  return next(count + 1);\n});\npipeline.use((count, next) => {\n  return count * 2;\n});\n\n// 3. exec\npipeline.run(1); // 4\npipeline.run(5); // 12\n\n\nIn this example, a Pipeline is created on line 3. This means that when you run\nit, you need to pass in a number, and you will get a number as a result, the\ntype is:\n\n(count: number, next: (nextCount: number) => number) => number;\n\n\nThe reason why there are only numbers here is because we created a Pipeline. If\nwe had created a Pipeline, then when we run it, we would pass in a number and\nget back a string. the type is:\n\n(count: number, next: (nextCount: number) => string) => string;\n\n\nAfter creating a Pipeline, you can add functions using the use method (lines 5\nand 8). It is important to note that the order in which you add the functions is\nthe order in which they will run by default.\n\nWithin these functions, you can manipulate the count value and return a value.\nIf you call the next function, the next function in the pipeline will run. For\nexample, if you add three functions: A, B, and C, and you call next in function\nA, then function B will run. Similarly, if you call next in function B, then\nfunction C will run.\n\nIn the example above, the first function added on line 5 calls next, which\ncauses the second function added on line 8 to run. The return value of this\nfunction is the return value of the entire pipeline. If the first function does\nnot call next and simply returns a value, then the pipeline will return that\nvalue without running any other functions.\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\n// 1. create\nconst pipeline = createPipeline();\n\n// 2. add function\npipeline.use((count, next) => {\n  return count + 1;\n});\npipeline.use((count, next) => {\n  return count * 2;\n});\n\n// 3. 执行\npipeline.run(1); // 2\npipeline.run(5); // 6\n\n\nIf the first function does not call next, the second function will not run and\nthe return value of the pipeline will be the return value of the first function.\n\nFinally, the way to run the Pipeline is simply to call pipeline.run().\n\n\nDifferences between different Hook models#\n\nThe above section describes the general working mode of the Pipeline, and the\nworking modes of other Hook models are similar. The main differences lie in the\nfunction type, execution order, and parameters.\n\n\nPipeline#\n\nThe example above describes the Pipeline, so we won't go into details here. In\nthe Pipeline category, there are two subcategories: Sync and Async, which manage\nfunctions of either Sync or Async type, respectively.\n\nINFO\nIf there are no functions in the Pipeline or all functions have called the next\nfunction, then you need to provide a value when running the Pipeline.\n\npipeline(\n  {},\n  {\n    onLast: () => {\n      // do something\n    },\n  },\n);\n\n\n:::\n\n\nWaterfall#\n\nThis model, as the name suggests, is characterized by the sequential passing of\nparameters, where the return value of the previous function becomes the input\nparameter of the next function. Let's look at an example::\n\n\n\n// 1. create\nconst waterfall = createWaterfall();\n\n// 2. add function\nwaterfall.use(count => {\n  return count + 1;\n});\nwaterfall.use(count => {\n  return count * 2;\n});\n\n// 3. exec\nwaterfall.run(1); // 4\nwaterfall.run(5); // 12\n\n\nIn this example, a Waterfall type is created, which means that the input and\noutput types of this model are the same. In this case, both the input and output\ntypes are number, the type is:\n\n(count: number) => number;\n\n\nAt first glance, this example may seem to have the same functionality as the\nPipeline above, but there are some important differences to note. Firstly, the\nfunctions managed by Waterfall do not have a next function as the second\nargument, so they cannot modify the execution order by calling next within the\nfunction. Secondly, the input and output types of the functions must be the same\n(unlike in the Pipeline where they can be different).\n\nSimilarly to Pipeline, Waterfall has Sync and Async subcategories that\nrespectively manage Sync and Async functions.\n\n\nWorkflow#\n\nThis Hook model is different from the two Hook models above in that there is no\nstrong concept of passing parameters and return values in a sequential order. In\nthis model, each function runs independently based on the same input parameter.\n\nfor example:\n\n\n\n// 1. create\nconst workflow = createWorkflow();\n\n// 2. add plugin\nworkflow.use(count => {\n  return count + 1;\n});\nworkflow.use(count => {\n  return count * 2;\n});\n\n// 3. 执行\nworkflow.run(1); // [2, 2]\nworkflow.run(5); // [6, 10]\n\n\nIn this example, two functions are added to the Workflow, so the result of\nrunning the Workflow is an array of the results of these two functions.\n\nAlthough there is no strong concept of passing parameters and return values in a\nsequential order in this model, there are still differences in the execution\norder. In the Workflow category, there are three subcategories: Sync, Async, and\nParallel.\n\nThe difference between them lies in the execution order of the functions. By\ndefault, they are all executed in the order they are added, but in Sync and\nAsync mode, the execution order is strictly based on the order in which they are\nadded, while in Parallel mode, a variant of Async mode, Promise.all is used to\nexecute all the functions, while in Async mode, await is used to wait for the\nprevious function to finish running.\n\n\nComparison of Hook models#\n\n\"Workflow\" and \"Waterfall\" are actually variants of the \"Pipeline\" model.

The\n   setup function can return a Hooks object, which Modern.js executes at\n   specific times.\n\nconst myPlugin = {\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup() {\n    const foo = '1';\n\n    // return hook object\n    return {\n      afterBuild: () => {\n      },\n    };\n  },\n};\n\n\nIn addition, plugins allow configuration of the execution order with other\nplugins. For more information, please refer to Plugin Relationship.\n\n\nPlugin Types#\n\nModern.js supports various types of project development, such as application\ndevelopment (app-tools), module development (module-tools), etc.\n\nTo balance the differences and commonalities between various types of project\ndevelopment, Modern.js organizes plugins as shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\nAs shown in the figure, Modern.js roughly divides plugins into two categories:\n\n 1. Common plugins: Plugins that only include some basic Hooks.\n\n 2. Project plugins: Different project developments will extend their own Hooks,\n    Config, etc. on the basis of common plugins.\n\nWhen using TypeScript, you can import built-in types such as CliPlugin to\nprovide correct type inference for plugins.\n\n\n\nconst myPlugin: CliPlugin = {\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup() {\n    const foo = '1';\n\n    return {\n      afterBuild: () => {\n      },\n    };\n  },\n};\n\n\nThe above code is a general-purpose plugin, containing only some basic Hooks.\nModern.js supports extending the definition of plugins through generics:\n\n\n\nconst myPlugin: CliPlugin = {\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup() {\n    const foo = '1';\n\n    return {\n      afterBuild: () => {\n      },\n    };\n  },\n};\n\n\nIf you look closely at the type AppTools, you can see that AppTools consists of\n3 types.\n\ntype AppTools = {\n  hooks: AppToolsHooks;\n  userConfig: AppToolsUserConfig;\n  normalizedConfig: AppToolsNormalizedConfig;\n};\n\n\nWhen writing plugins, plugins extend their own types like Hooks on different\nbases through generic extensions:\n\n// common plugin\n\n\n\nconst myPlugin: CliPlugin<{ hooks: MyPluginHook }> = {};\n\n\n// extend from app-tools hook\n\n\n\nconst myPlugin: CliPlugin = {};\n\n\nPlease refer to Extending Hooks for detailed explanations.\n\n\nPlugin Configuration#\n\nIt is recommended to write plugins in the form of functions, so that plugins can\nreceive configuration options through function parameters:\n\n\n\ntype MyPluginOptions = {\n  foo: string;\n};\n\nconst myPlugin = (options: MyPluginOptions): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup() {\n    console.log(options.foo);\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nPlugin API#\n\nThe setup function of a plugin receives an api parameter, and you can call some\nmethods provided on the api to get configuration, application context, and other\ninformation.\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup(api) {\n    // get user set config\n    const config = api.useConfigContext();\n    // get context\n    const appContext = api.useAppContext();\n    // get final config\n    const resolvedConfig = api.useResolvedConfigContext();\n  },\n});\n\n\nFor more detail Plugin API.\n\n\nAsync setup#\n\nThe setup function of a CLI plugin can be an asynchronous function, which can\nexecute asynchronous logic during the initialization process.\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  async setup(api) {\n    await doSomething();\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nAdding Plugins#\n\nCustom plugins can be used by following the instructions in the plugins section\nof the documentation. Below is the recommended way to implement plugins in\nModern.js.\n\n\nDeveloping Local Plugins#\n\nIt is recommended to write local plugins in the config/plugin directory and\nexport them using export default:\n\nconfig/plugin/myPlugin.ts\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup() {\n    // init plugin\n  },\n});\n\n\nregister plugin in modern.config.ts:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [myPlugin()],\n});\n\n\n\nPublishing a Plugin on npm#\n\nIf you want to publish your Modern.js plugin on npm, it's recommended to use the\nmodule project solution provided by Modern.js to manage and build the plugin.\n\nFirst, create an empty module project solution and adjust the package name:\n\n{\n  \"name\": \"my-plugin\"\n  ...\n}\n\n\ncreate plugin main file:\n\nsrc/index.ts\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup() {\n    // plugin init\n  },\n});\n\n\nAfter publishing, install it to the project you need to use pnpm add my-plugin,\ntake an application project as an example, and then add it in modern.config.ts:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [myPlugin()],\n});\n\n\nIf you find that there are currently unsatisfactory scenarios in Modern.js,\nwelcome to build the Modern.js ecosystem together by writing custom plugins.","frontmatter":{"title":"Write Plugins","sidebar_position":3}},{"id":218,"title":"Introduction","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/framework-plugin/introduction","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Modern.js Plugin System","id":"modern.js-plugin-system","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"What Plugins Can Do","id":"what-plugins-can-do","depth":2,"charIndex":1297}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\n\nModern.js Plugin System#\n\nModern.js is a system used for extending the functionality of a project at\ndifferent stages such as running, requesting, and rendering. It mainly consists\nof three parts: the Hook model, the Manager, and the Context Sharing mechanism.\n\nThe Hook model is used to determine the execution method of the current Hook,\nand functions with different Hook models have different execution logics. The\nManager is used to control the execution and scheduling of Hooks. The Context\nSharing mechanism is used to pass information between different Hooks.\n\nCurrently, Modern.js provides several different Hook models:\n\n * Pipeline\n   * Sync\n   * Async\n * Waterfall\n   * Sync\n   * Async\n * Workflow\n   * Sync\n   * Async\n   * Parallel(Async)\n\nNOTE\nSubsequent chapters will introduce the execution methods of each model in\ndetail.\n\nBased on the Hook model and Manager, Modern.js exposes three sets of plugins:\nCLI, Runtime, and Server.\n\nAmong them, the CLI plugin is the main running flow control model in Modern.js,\nand most of the features in Modern.js are mainly run through this set of models.\nThe Runtime plugin is mainly responsible for processing the rendering logic of\nReact components. The Server plugin is mainly used for controlling the server\nlifecycle and user requests.\n\n\nWhat Plugins Can Do#\n\nAll of Modern.js's features are implemented through this set of plugins, which\nmeans that all of Modern.js's capabilities are open to developers. Developers\ncan write plugins to extend more functionality and adapt to complex scenarios,\nincluding but not limited to:\n\n * Registering commands\n * Modifying Modern.js configuration and validation schema\n * Modifying compilation configurations for Webpack/Babel/Less/Sass/Tailwind\n   CSS/...\n * Modifying the React components/elements to be rendered at runtime\n * Modifying page routing\n * Modifying server routing\n * Customizing console output\n * Customizing dynamic HTML templates\n * Customizing Node.js server frameworks\n * Customizing React component client/server rendering\n * ...\n\nWhen Modern.js does not currently cover the functionality or scenario that you\nneed, you can develop a custom plugin to implement the related functionality for\nadapting to special scenarios.","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","sidebar_position":1}},{"id":219,"title":"Lifecycle","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/framework-plugin/lifecycle","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModern.js application has a complete lifecycle, including CLI, Server Side and\nRuntime three stages.\n\nModern.js lifecycle is as follows:\n\nNOTE\nThe rectangle of the pink box represents the plugin hook provided by the\nModern.js, and the light yellow base color ellipse represents the linkage point\nwith the next stage.\n\n","frontmatter":{"title":"Lifecycle","sidebar_position":1}},{"id":220,"title":"Plugin API","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/framework-plugin/plugin-api","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"API","id":"api","depth":2,"charIndex":503},{"text":"useConfigContext","id":"useconfigcontext","depth":3,"charIndex":510},{"text":"useResolvedConfigContext","id":"useresolvedconfigcontext","depth":3,"charIndex":1008},{"text":"useAppContext","id":"useappcontext","depth":3,"charIndex":1610},{"text":"useHookRunners","id":"usehookrunners","depth":3,"charIndex":2145}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nThe setup function of the plugin will receive an api imported parameter, and you\ncan call some methods provided on the api to obtain information such as\nconfiguration and application context.\n\n\n\nexport default (): CliPlugin => ({\n  name: 'my-plugin',\n\n  setup(api) {\n    // get user config\n    const config = api.useConfigContext();\n    // get plugin context\n    const appContext = api.useAppContext();\n    // get resolved config\n    const resolvedConfig = api.useResolvedConfigContext();\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nAPI#\n\n\nuseConfigContext#\n\nUsed to retrieve the original configuration of the application.\n\nconst useConfigContext: () => UserConfig;\n\ninterface UserConfig {\n  source?: SourceConfig;\n  output?: OutputConfig;\n  server?: ServerConfig;\n  deploy?: DeployConfig;\n  // ...other fields\n}\n\n\nPlease refer to Configuration for the specific meanings of configuration fields.\n\nTIP\nThis method returns a read-only configuration and cannot be modified.

Of course, Modern.js also provides the\ncorresponding generator plugin (@modern-js/generator-plugin-plugin) to directly\ncreate a new generator plugin project.\n\nA generator plugin project directory is as follows:\n\n.\n├── README.md\n├── package.json\n├── src\n│   ├── index.ts\n│   └── modern-app-env.d.ts\n├── templates\n└── tsconfig.json\n\n\nThe src/index.ts is the source code directory, which is used to develop the\ngenerator plugin logic. The plugin exports a function by default, and the\nfunction parameter is context. Some methods are provided on the context to\ndirectly operate the current project. These methods will be introduced in detail\nlater in this chapter.\n\nThe templates directory is the template directory used to store template files\nthat need to be used in the generator plugin.\n\n\nClassification#\n\nThere are two types of generator plugins:\n\n 1. Extended engineering: directly customize the three major engineering\n    provided by default.\n\n 2.

At present, there are two configuration\nmethods for sub-app information, and these two methods are applied to different\nscenarios.\n\n\nRegister sub-app info directly#\n\nYou can register the sub-application information directly through the\nconfiguration:\n\nTIP\nIt can be configured at runtime via the API defineConfig.\n\nWhen the parameter is a function, it cannot be serialized to the product code,\nso please configure it through defineConfig when it comes to configuration such\nas functions\n\nsrc/App.tsx\n\n\n\ndefineConfig(App, {\n  masterApp: {\n    apps: [{\n      name: 'Table',\n      entry: 'http://localhost:8001',\n      // activeWhen: '/table'\n    }, {\n      name: 'Dashboard',\n      entry: 'http://localhost:8002'\n      // activeWhen: '/dashboard'\n    }]\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nCustom remote app list#\n\nThis function allows you to pull a list of remote child applications and\nregister them with the runtime framework:\n\nApp.tsx\n\ndefineConfig(App, {\n  masterApp: {\n    manifest: {\n      getAppList: async () => {\n        // get from remote api\n        return [{\n          name: 'Table',\n          entry: 'http://localhost:8001',\n          // activeWhen: '/table'\n        }, {\n          name: 'Dashboard',\n          entry: 'http://localhost:8002'\n          // activeWhen: '/dashboard'\n        }];\n      },\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nRenderer sub-app#\n\nThere are two ways to load sub-app in micro frontend:\n\n 1. **Sub-app component ** Get the components of each sub-app, and then you can\n    render the sub-app of micro frontend just like using ordinary'React\n    'components.\n 2. Centralized routing Through centralized routing configuration, the\n    corresponding sub-app of rendering is automatically activated according to\n    the current page pathname.\n\n\nSub-app component#\n\nDevelopers can use the useModuleApps method to obtain the components of each\nchild application.\n\nThrough the combined use of the router component, developers can autonomously\nrender different sub-applications according to different routes.\n\nSuppose our subapp list is configured as follows:\n\nApp.tsx as follow:\n\nApp.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\nconst AppLayout = () => (\n  <>\n    \nload file-based sub-app\n    \nload self-controlled sub-app\n    \nunmount sub-app\n    \n  </>\n)\n\nexport default () => {\n  const { apps, MApp } = useModuleApps();\n\n  // Instead of using the MApp component, you need to use createBrowserRouter to create the route\n  const router = createBrowserRouter(\n    createRoutesFromElements(\n      }>\n        {apps.map(app => {\n          const { Component } = app;\n          // Fuzzy match, path needs to be written in a pattern similar to abc/*\n          return (\n             {\n                    if (error) {\n                      return \nerror: {error?.message};\n                    } else if (pastDelay) {\n                      return \nloading;\n                    } else {\n                      return null;\n                    }\n                  },\n                }}\n              />\n              }\n            />\n          )\n        })}\n      \n    )\n  );\n\n  return (\n    // Use MApp to automatically load sub-applications according to the configured activeWhen parameters (this project is configured in modern.config.ts)\n    // \n    //   \n    // \n\n    // Manually write the Route component to load the sub-application, which is convenient for scenarios that require pre-operation such as authentication\n    <>\n      \n    </>\n  );\n};\n\n\nHere, the activation route of Table is customized as /table through the Route\ncomponent, and the activation route of Dashboard is /dashboard.\n\n\nCentralized routing#\n\nCentralized Routing is a way to centrally configure active routes for subapps.\nWe enable Centralized Routing by adding an activeWhen field to the subapp list\ninformation.\n\nUse useModuleApp api in Main App, get MApp component and then render it\n\nMain\n\n\n\nfunction App() {\n  const { MApp } = useModuleApps();\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nAfter starting the application in this way, accessing the '/table' route will\nrender the'Table 'sub-application, and accessing the'/dashboard 'route will\nrender the'Dashboard' sub-application.\n\n\nMix Mode#\n\nOf course, sub-application components and centralized routing can be mixed.\n\n * One molecular application is activated as a sub-application component, and\n   the other part is activated as a centralized routing.\n * A molecular application can be activated either as a centralized routing or\n   as a sub-application component.\n\n\nLoading#\n\nBy configuring the loadable configuration, loading components can be added for\n「centralized routing」 and 「sub-applicati」, and errors, timeouts, flashes, etc.\ncan be considered, so as to provide users with a better user experience. The\ndesign and implementation of this function refer to react-loadable, and the\nbasic functions are similar.\n\nfunction Loading() {\n  return \nLoading...;\n}\n\nfunction App(){\n  return <>\n    \n\nAdd Error Status#\n\nWhen the micro-frontend sub-application fails to load or render, the loading\ncomponent will receive the error parameter (if there is no error, the error is\nnull).\n\nfunction Loading({ error }) {\n  if (error) {\n    return \nError msg {error?.message};\n  } else {\n    return \nLoading...;\n  }\n}\n\n\nAvoid Loading Flash Back#\n\nSometimes the display time of the loading component may be less than 200ms, and\nthe loading component will flash back at this time. Many user studies have\nproved that the loading flash back situation will cause the user to perceive\nthat the loading content takes longer than the actual time.\n\nWhen loading is less than 200ms, if the content is not displayed, the user will\nthink it is faster.\n\nTherefore, the loading component also provides the pastDelay parameter, which\nwill only be true when it exceeds the set delay display. You can set the delay\nduration through the delay parameter.\n\nfunction Loading({ error, pastDelay }) {\n  if (error) {\n    return \nError! {error?.message};\n  } else if (pastDelay) {\n    return \nLoading...;\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe default value of delay is 200ms, you can set the delay display time through\ndelay in loadable.\n\n\nfunction App(){\n  return <>\n    \n\nAdd Timeout State#\n\nSometimes because of the network, the micro-front-end sub-application fails to\nload, resulting in the loading state being displayed all the time, which is very\nbad for users, because they don't know the right response to get a specific\nresponse, whether they need to refresh the page, by Increasing the timeout state\ncan solve this problem well.\n\nThe loading component will get the timeOut parameter when timeout, when the\nmicro frontend application loads timeout, it will get the timeOut property value\nof true.\n\nfunction Loading({ error, timeOut, pastDelay }) {\n  if (error) {\n    return \nError! {error?.message};\n  } else if (timeOut) {\n    return \nLoading timed out, please refresh the page... ;\n  } else if (pastDelay) {\n    return \nLoading...;\n  } else {\n    return null;\n  }\n}\n\n\nThe timeout state is off and can be enabled by setting the timeout parameter in\nloadable:\n\n\nfunction App(){\n  return <>\n    ","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":3,"title":"Develop Main App"}},{"id":273,"title":"Communicate","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/micro-frontend/c04-communicate","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Props","id":"props","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"channel","id":"channel","depth":2,"charIndex":616}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\n\nProps#\n\nIn Modern.js, the sub-application will be wrapped into a React component, and\nthe purpose of communicating between the main application and the\nsub-application can be achieved directly by passing'props' to the React\ncomponent.\n\nMain:\n\nfunction App() {\n  const { MApp } = useModuleApps();\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nMain:\n\nfunction App(props) {\n  console.log(props);\n  return ...\n}\n\n\nThe child application will print {count: 0}.

This logic can be directly\nwritten in the component or implemented through derived states in Model. Derived\nstates are defined under the computed field in the Model. Depending on the\ndependencies of the Model and the return type, there are three ways to define\nderived states.\n\n\nOnly Depend on the Model's Own State#\n\nThe derived state only depends on the current Model's State, which is passed as\nthe first parameter to the derived state's definition function.\n\nFor example, the todo application has items and filter in its State, and filter\nis used to filter the todo items displayed on the current page. Therefore, we\ndefine a visibleTodos derived state that can be directly used in the component.\nThe sample code is as follows:\n\n/**\n *  Assuming the structure of the todo item is as follows:\n{\n    id: string;          // id\n    text: string;        // todo\n    completed: boolean;\n}\n**/\n\nconst todoModel = model('todo').define({\n  state: {\n    items: [],\n    filter: 'ALL', // ALL: show all；COMPLETED: show completed；ACTIVE: show active\n  },\n  computed: {\n    visibleTodos: state => {\n      switch (state.filter) {\n        case 'ALL':\n          return state.items;\n        case 'COMPLETED':\n          return todos.filter(t => t.completed);\n        case 'ACTIVE':\n          return todos.filter(t => !t.completed);\n        default:\n          return [];\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nDerived state will eventually be merged with the Model's State, so the derived\nstate can be accessed through the Model's State object. For example, the\nvisibleTodos can be used in the component as follows:\n\nfunction Todo() {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(todoModel);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n        {state.visibleTodos.map(item => (\n          \n{item.text}\n        ))}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\n\nDependent State from Other Models#\n\nIn addition to depending on the current model's state, derived states may also\ndepend on the state of other models. In this case, the definition format for the\nderived state is:\n\n[stateKey]: [...depModels, (selfState, ...depModels) => computedState]\n\n\nThe following example demonstrates how the derived state combinedValue of\nbarModel depends on the state of fooModel.\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 'foo',\n  },\n});\n\nconst barModel = model('bar').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 'foo',\n  },\n  computed: {\n    combinedValue: [\n      fooModel,\n      (state, fooState) => state.value + fooState.value,\n    ],\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nDerived State with Function Type#\n\nDerived states can also return a function. In this case, the definition format\nfor the derived state is:\n\n[stateKey]: (state) => (...args) => computedState    // Only relies on its own state\n[stateKey]: [...depModels, (selfState, ...depModels) => (...args) => computedState]  // Relies on the state of other models\n\n\nAssuming the filter state is not stored in the state of the todo app, but is\ninstead used directly in the component, visibleTodos can be a function type\nvalue. This function receives the filter parameter when used in the component,\nas shown below:\n\nconst todoModel = model('todo').define({\n  state: {\n    items: [],\n  },\n  computed: {\n    visibleTodos: state => filter => {\n      switch (filter) {\n        case 'ALL':\n          return state.items;\n        case 'COMPLETED':\n          return todos.filter(t => t.completed);\n        case 'ACTIVE':\n          return todos.filter(t => !t.completed);\n        default:\n          return [];\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nfunction Todo(props) {\n  // use props pass filter\n  const { filter } = props;\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(todoModel);\n\n  // get final todos\n  const todos = state.visibleTodos(filter);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n        {todos.map(item => (\n          \n{item.text}\n        ))}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nAdditional Reference\nUsing Models","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":4,"title":"Derived State"}},{"id":277,"title":"Define Model","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/model/define-model","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nIn the previous section, we demonstrated how to create a Model for a simple\ncounter application. In this section, we will provide a detailed introduction on\nhow to create a Model.\n\nWe can create a Model using the model API. For example, model('foo') creates a\nModel named foo. We can define the State and Actions included in the Model by\ncalling the define function returned by model('foo'):\n\n\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 'foo',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setValue: (state, payload){\n      state.value = payload\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\nINFO\n * Actions in the Model cannot contain side-effect logic, such as requesting\n   HTTP interfaces, accessing localStorage, etc.\n * setValue directly modifies the input State, which seems to violate the\n   definition of a pure function. However, Reduck uses immer internally to\n   modify immutable objects, ensuring that this approach does not affect the\n   immutability of the object, so setValue is still a pure function. Of course,\n   you can also return a new object directly in the Action, but this approach\n   will be more complex.\n\nThe define function only describes the original structure of the Model,\nincluding the internally defined State, Actions, and so on. The fooModel\nreturned by define is the actual Model object that is created. For example,\nalthough setValue has two parameters, when we call the setValue Action, we only\nneed to pass in the payload parameter, because we are calling the Action method\non fooModel, not the one described in the original structure of the Model. For\nmore information, please refer to Using Models.\n\nIn addition to object-type parameters, define can also receive function-type\nparameters. For example:\n\n\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define((context, utils) => {\n  return {\n    state: {\n      value: 'foo',\n    },\n    actions: {\n      setValue: (state, payload){\n        state.value = payload\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n\nWhen defining a Model using a function, the function automatically receives two\nparameters: context and utils. context is the context object of Reduck, which\ncan obtain the store object, and utils provides a set of utility functions to\nfacilitate the implementation of complex features such as Model communication.\n\nModels support duplication. For example:\n\nconst barModel = fooModel('bar');\n\n\nbarModel is a new Model object created based on fooModel.

However, in real-world scenarios, we often encounter many side\neffects, such as: requesting data from an HTTP API to obtain state data, or\nmodifying localStorage or sending events while updating the state. In Reduck,\nside effects are managed through the model's effects function.\n\n\nModifying State via Side Effects#\n\nThe most common scenario in which side effects modify the state is requesting\ndata from an HTTP API to update state data.\n\nLet's take a simple todoModel as an example. It has a side effect function load\nthat requests the TODO list from a remote server. After the request succeeds, it\nupdates the state.items field.\n\nconst todoModel = model('todo').define({\n  state: {\n    items: [],\n    loading: false,\n    error: null,\n  },\n  actions: {\n    load: {\n      pending(state) {\n        state.loading = true;\n      },\n      fulfilled(state, items) {\n        state.items = items;\n        state.loading = false;\n      },\n      rejected(state, error) {\n        state.error = error;\n        state.loading = false;\n      },\n    },\n  },\n  effects: {\n    // Promise effects\n    async load() {\n      return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(() => resolve(['Learn Modern.js']), 2000);\n      });\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nThe side effect function is uniformly defined under the effects field. Here we\nhave written a load function that returns a Promise. After the Promise is\nsuccessfully executed, it returns the TODO list [\"Lerna Modern.js\"].\n\nSide effect functions need to work with actions to modify state. Therefore, we\ndefine a load object in actions (the name needs to be consistent with the name\nof the side effect function under effects), which includes three actions\n(pending, fulfilled, rejected) that handle the three states (pending, fulfilled,\nrejected) of the Promise returned by the side effect function load:\n\n * pending: Receives the current state state as a parameter and sets the loading\n   flag to true in the new state.\n * fulfilled: Receives the current state state and the Promise fulfilled value\n   items as parameters, and sets items to the parameter items and loading to\n   false in the new state.\n * rejected: Receives the current state state and the Promise rejected error\n   error as parameters, and sets error to the parameter error and loading to\n   false in the new state.\n\nHow do we call the effects function in the component? The effects function will\nbe merged into the actions object, so you can call the effects function through\nthe actions object, as shown below:\n\nfunction Todo() {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(todoModel);\n\n  useEffect(() => {\n    // invoke effects function\n    actions.load();\n  }, []);\n\n  if (state.loading) {\n    return \nloading....;\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n        {state.items.map((item, index) => (\n          \n{item}\n        ))}\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nIn the example above, the three actions pending, fulfilled, and rejected are\ngenerally required for HTTP requests used to obtain data. Reduck provides a\nutility function handleEffect to simplify the creation of actions in this\nscenario.\n\nFor this type of side effect scenario, handleEffect stipulates that the state\nstructure of the model contains three fields: result, error, and pending, with\ninitial values of:\n\n{\n  result: null,\n  error: null,\n  pending: false,\n}\n\n\nCalling handleEffect will return the following data structure:\n\n{\n  pending() { // ... },\n  fulfilled() { // ... },\n  rejected() { // ... }\n}\n\n\nThis data structure is the same as the data structure of the load object under\nactions. The object returned by handleEffect actually corresponds to the three\nactions required by the Effects function.\n\nWe can use handleEffect to rewrite todoModel:\n\nconst todoModel = model('todo').define({\n  state: {\n    items: [],\n    loading: false,\n    error: null,\n  },\n  actions: {\n    load: handleEffect({ result: 'items' }),\n  },\n  effects: {\n    // Promise effects\n    async load() {\n      return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(() => resolve(['Learn Modern.js']), 2000);\n      });\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nThe handleEffect function sets result to items in the received parameter object.\nBecause todoModel uses items as the key to save the TODO list data instead of\nusing the default result as the key of handleEffect, configuration is required\nhere.\n\nIt is obvious that the todoModel implemented through handleEffect is much more\nconcise than the previous implementation.\n\nIf you do not want all three states (pending, fulfilled, rejected) to be\nautomatically handled by handleEffect, for example, if the fulfilled state\nrequires more complex data processing and needs to be manually handled, but you\nstill want to automate the handling of the pending and rejected states, you can\nuse the following method:\n\n  actions: {\n    load: {\n      ...handleEffect(),\n      fulfilled(state, payload) {\n        // manual handle\n      },\n    },\n  },\n\n\nhandleEffect API.\n\nIn the Effects function, you can also manually call Actions. For example:\n\nconst todoModel = model('todo').define((context, utils) => ({\n  state: {\n    items: [],\n    loading: false,\n    error: null,\n  },\n  actions: {\n    pending(state) {\n      state.loading = true;\n    },\n    fulfilled(state, items) {\n      state.items = items;\n      state.loading = false;\n    },\n  },\n  effects: {\n    async load() {\n      // use utils.use get cuttent Model actions\n      const [, actions] = utils.use(todoModel);\n      // invoke action\n      actions.pending();\n\n      return new Promise(resolve => {\n        setTimeout(() => {\n          const items = ['Learn Modern.js'];\n          // invoke action\n          actions.fulfilled(items);\n          resolve(items);\n        }, 2000);\n      });\n    },\n  },\n}));\n\n\nYou can use the use function to load other Models (including the Model itself)\nto achieve Model communication.\n\n\nSide effects do not affect state#\n\nIn some cases, we only need to read State and execute relevant side effect\nlogic, and the side effect will not modify State.\n\nFor example, store some State in localStorage:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define((context, utils) => ({\n  state: {\n    value: 'foo',\n  },\n  effects: {\n    setLocalStorage(key) {\n      const [state] = utils.use(fooModel);\n      localStorage.set(key, state.value);\n      return 'success';\n    },\n  },\n}));\n\n\nor send message to server:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 'foo',\n  },\n  effects: {\n    async sendData(data) {\n      const res = await fetch('url', {\n        method: 'POST',\n        body: data,\n      });\n      return res.json();\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nSometimes, we want to execute subsequent logic directly based on the execution\nresult of the side effect function. In this case, we need to use the return\nvalue of the Effects function.\n\nFor example, when the send button is clicked and the data is successfully sent,\nclose the current popup immediately; if it fails, display an error message. We\ncan achieve this through the following code:\n\n// The code is for illustration only and cannot be executed.\n// Response function of the \"send\" button within the component.\nconst handleClick = async () => {\n  // sendData returns a string that represents the state.\n  const result = await actions.sendData('some data');\n  if (result === 'success') {\n    // Close the popup window.\n    closeModal();\n  } else {\n    // show error\n    showError(result);\n  }\n};\n\n\nINFO\nExample","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":5,"title":"Management Effect"}},{"id":280,"title":"Model Communication","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/model/model-communicate","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Communication between Models","id":"communication-between-models","depth":2,"charIndex":150},{"text":"Communication within a Model","id":"communication-within-a-model","depth":2,"charIndex":4221}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nModel communication refers to communication between different Models, as well as\ncommunication between Effects and Actions within the same Model.\n\n\nCommunication between Models#\n\nModels are not isolated from each other and can communicate with each other.\nThere are mainly two scenarios:\n\n 1. Accessing the State and Actions of other Models in the Model.\n 2. Listening to changes in other Models in the Model.\n\nHere, we will transform the simple counter application in the Quick Start\nsection into a counter application that allows you to set the step frequency. By\nsetting the step frequency, you can affect the magnitude of each counter\nincrease.\n\nWe abstract two Models, stepModel (step frequency) and counterModel (counter):\n\n\n\nconst stepModel = model('step').define({\n  state: 1,\n});\n\nconst counterModel = model('count').define((context, { use, onMount }) => {\n  const [, , subscribeStep] = use(stepModel);\n\n  onMount(() => {\n    return subscribeStep(() => {\n      console.log(\n        `Subscribe in counterModel: stepModel change to ${use(stepModel)[0]}`,\n      );\n    });\n  });\n\n  return {\n    state: {\n      value: 1,\n    },\n    actions: {\n      add(state) {\n        const step = use(stepModel)[0];\n        state.value += step;\n      },\n    },\n  };\n});\n\nexport { stepModel, counterModel };\n\n\nstepModel declares only one state, with an initial value of 1.\n\ncounterModel loads stepModel with the use function, and retrieves the returned\nsubscribeStep function to listen for changes to the stepModel state. onMount is\na hook function that is executed after the Model is mounted. counterModel begins\nto subscribe to the state changes of stepModel after it has been mounted, and\nprints out the latest value of stepModel.\n\ncounterModel accesses stepModel using the use function, and in the add function,\nthe current value of stepModel (step frequency) can be obtained to perform\nincrements using this value.\n\nNote\nWhen you need to access the state of another Model, you must call use during the\nactual execution phase of the current Actions or Effects function (in this\nexample, the add function) to ensure that the obtained State is the latest\nvalue. Therefore, although we also call use(stepModel) in the callback function\nof define, we do not destructure the state value of stepModel because the\ncallback function of define is executed during the mounting phase of the Model,\nand at this time, the state of stepModel obtained may be different from the\nvalue obtained when add is executed.\n\nModify App.tsx:\n\n\n\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(counterModel);\n  const [step, stepActions] = useModel(stepModel);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \nstep: {step}\n       stepActions.setState(step + 1)}>add step\n      \ncounter: {state.value}\n       actions.add()}>add counter\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default function App() {\n  return ;\n}\n\n\nAdditional Information\nModern.js has enabled auto-generate actions by default, so even though there are\nno Actions defined manually in the stepModel, the auto-generated setState can\nstill be used.\n * Click add step to add steps.\n * Click add counter to trigger the counter to increase.\n\nThe final effect is as follows:\n\n\n\nAdditional Information\n * Full example code for this section can be found here.\n * For more information about the relevant API, please refer to: model.\n\nIn the previous example of counterModel, we called use within the Actions\nfunction to get other Model objects. If we only need to call Actions of other\nModels, we can also use use to get the Actions of Models in the define callback\nfunction because Actions are functions and there is no issue of value\nexpiration. For example:\n\nconst barModel = model('bar').define({\n  // ..\n});\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define((context, utils) => {\n  // get barModel actions\n  const [, actions] = utils.use(barModel);\n  return {\n    // ...\n    effects: {\n      async loadA() {\n        // ...\n        // invoke barModel action\n        barModel.actionA();\n      },\n      async loadB() {\n        // ...\n        // invoke barModel action\n        barModel.actionB();\n      },\n    },\n  };\n});\n\n\nHere, we no longer need to repeatedly get the barModel object in loadA and\nloadB, which simplifies the code logic.\n\n\nCommunication within a Model#\n\nCommunication within a Model can also be divided into two main scenarios:\n\n 1. Effects functions call the Actions functions of the same Model or other\n    Effects functions.\n 2. Actions functions call other Actions functions of the same Model.\n\nIn the Managing Side Effects section, we demonstrated how Effects functions call\nActions functions.\n\nHere we provide another example:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define((context, { use, onMount }) => ({\n  state: {\n    a: '',\n    b: '',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setA(state, payload) {\n      state.a = payload;\n    },\n    setB(state, payload) {\n      state.a = payload;\n    },\n  },\n  effects: {\n    async loadA() {\n      // get current Model actions\n      const [, actions] = use(fooModel);\n      const res = await mockFetchA();\n      actions.setA(res);\n    },\n    async loadB() {\n      // get current Model actions\n      const [, actions] = use(fooModel);\n      const res = await mockFetchB();\n      actions.setB(res);\n    },\n  },\n}));\n\n\nIn this example, the two Effects functions of fooModel need to call their own\nActions functions. Here, we have called use once in each Effects function. Why\ncan't we use use to get the Actions of the Model itself in the define callback\nfunction, as in the example of Model communication? This is because when calling\nuse to get a Model, it first checks whether the Model has been mounted. If it\nhas not been mounted, the mounting logic will be executed first.\n\nThe define callback function is executed during the mounting phase, so calling\nuse to get the Model itself during the mounting phase will result in an infinite\nloop (which will throw an error in the actual execution process). Therefore, you\nmust not call use in the define callback function to get the Model itself.\n\nHowever, we can use the onMount hook function to get the Model itself through\nuse after the Model has been mounted:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define((context, { use, onMount }) => {\n  let actions;\n\n  onMount(() => {\n    // after fooModel mounted, get actions\n    [, actions] = use(fooModel);\n  });\n\n  return {\n    state: {\n      a: '',\n      b: '',\n    },\n    actions: {\n      setA(state, payload) {\n        state.a = payload;\n      },\n      setB(state, payload) {\n        state.a = payload;\n      },\n    },\n    effects: {\n      async loadA() {\n        const res = await mockFetchA();\n        actions.setA(res);\n      },\n      async loadB() {\n        const res = await mockFetchB();\n        actions.setB(res);\n      },\n    },\n  };\n});\n\n\nIn this way, we can also simplify the code.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":7,"title":"Model Communication"}},{"id":281,"title":"Performance Optimization","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/model/performance","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Splitting Models","id":"splitting-models","depth":2,"charIndex":317},{"text":"State Selection","id":"state-selection","depth":2,"charIndex":1341},{"text":"Derivative State Caching","id":"derivative-state-caching","depth":2,"charIndex":2156}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nReduck has already done a lot of performance optimization work internally, so\nperformance issues generally do not need to be considered. However, when\nperformance is more sensitive, or when encountering performance issues, you can\nconsider more targeted performance optimization from the following three\naspects.\n\n\nSplitting Models#\n\nWhen useModel returns the complete State object of the Model, any change in any\npart of the State will cause the component that calls useModel to be\nre-rendered.\n\nFor example:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    a: '',\n    b: '',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setA(state, payload) {\n      state.a = payload;\n    },\n    setB(state, payload) {\n      state.b = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nfunction ComponentA() {\n  const [state] = useModel(fooModel);\n\n  return \n{state.a};\n}\n\n\nAlthough ComponentA only needs to use the a state, it will still be re-rendered\nwhen the b state changes. In this case, we can consider splitting fooModel into\nseparate Models responsible for managing a and b respectively:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    a: '',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setA(state, payload) {\n      state.a = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst barModel = model('bar').define({\n  state: {\n    b: '',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setB(state, payload) {\n      state.b = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nState Selection#\n\nuseModel supports passing in a selector function to filter the returned State\nand Actions for the component. We can use a selector function to ensure that the\nState returned to the component is what the component needs directly, thus\nensuring that the component is not re-rendered due to changes in other unrelated\nstates.\n\nFor the same example above, we can use a selector function for performance\noptimization, the code is as follows:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    a: '',\n    b: '',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setA(state, payload) {\n      state.a = payload;\n    },\n    setB(state, payload) {\n      state.b = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nfunction ComponentA() {\n  // 通过传入 selector 函数，只返回 a 状态给组件\n  const [stateA] = useModel(fooModel, state => state.a);\n\n  return \n{stateA};\n}\n\n\n\nDerivative State Caching#\n\nWhen a Model has computed property, the computed function will be executed every\ntime useModel is called.\n\nConsider the following code:\n\nconst barModel = model('bar').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 'bar',\n  },\n  computed: {\n    combineA: [\n      fooModel, // fooModel define as above\n      (state, fooState) => {\n        return state + fooState.a;\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setValue(state, payload) {\n      state.value = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nfunction ComponentB() {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(fooModel);\n  const [{ combineA }] = useModel(barModel);\n  // ...\n}\n\n\nEven if the b state of fooModel changes, the combineA function (more precisely,\nthe last function type element of combineA) will still be called and executed\nwhen the component is re-rendered, although the derivative state combineA of\nbarModel depends on barModel itself and the state a of fooModel.\n\nIn general, the logic in the computed function is usually very lightweight, but\nwhen the logic in the computed function is relatively complex, we can consider\ncaching the calculation logic. For example, we can use reselect to cache\ncombineA of barModel:\n\n\n\n// create cache function\nconst selectCombineA = createSelector(\n  (state) => state.bar.value,\n  (state) => state.foo.a,\n  (barState, fooState) => {\n    return barState + fooState;\n  }\n);\n\nconst barModel = model(\"bar\").define({\n  state: {\n    value: \"bar\",\n  },\n  computed: {\n    combineA: [\n      fooModel,\n      (state, fooState) => {\n        return selectCombineA({\n          foo: fooState,\n          bar: state,\n        });\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setValue(state, payload) {\n      state.value = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nWe created a caching function createSelector, which only recalculates the value\nof combineA when the state of barModel changes or the state a of fooModel\nchanges.\n\nAdditional Information\nYou can find the complete example code of this section here.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":8,"title":"Performance Optimization"}},{"id":282,"title":"Quick Start","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/model/quick-start","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Core Concepts","id":"core-concepts","depth":2,"charIndex":1338},{"text":"Basic Usage","id":"basic-usage","depth":2,"charIndex":1895}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nReduck is a state management library developed by the Modern.js team that\nfollows the MVC pattern. Its underlying state storage is based on Redux\nimplementation, while providing a higher level of abstraction and full\ncompatibility with the Redux ecosystem.\n\nThe goal of Reduck is to organize the development structure of React\napplications in the MVC pattern, maintain business logic in the Model layer,\ndecoupling business logic from UI, making it easier for developers to focus on\nbusiness logic, and reducing duplicated work (boilerplate code) through higher\nlevel of abstraction.\n\nIn the MVC pattern, Reduck plays the role of M(Model), React UI Component\ncorresponds to V(View), and gets the Model from Reduck and modifies the Model's\nReact Container Component, which corresponds to C(View Controller/Container).\n\nThe state management solution of Modern.js is implemented through built-in\nReduck. Using Reduck in Modern.js not only eliminates the manual integration\nprocess, but also allows all Reduck APIs to be imported and used directly from\nthe Modern.js Runtime package, providing a better consistency experience.\n\nINFO\n 1. To use Reduck APIs in Modern.js, you need to set runtime.state to enable the\n    state management plugin.\n 2. Reduck can also be used separately as a state management library outside of\n    Modern.js.\n\n\nCore Concepts#\n\nThere are only four core concepts in Reduck: Model, State, Actions, and Effects.\n\nModel: Encapsulates the logic and required state of an independent module,\nconsisting of State, Actions, and Effects.\n\nState: The state stored in the Model.\n\nActions: Pure functions used to modify State, functions must be Synchronous.\n\nEffects: Functions with side effects used to modify State, functions can be\nAsynchronous. Effects can call their own Actions and Effects or those of other\nModels.\n\nThe Reduck data flow is shown in the following figure:\n\n\n\n\nBasic Usage#\n\nNext, let's take a simple Counter application as an example to demonstrate the\nbasic usage of Reduck.\n\nFirst, we define a Model named count:\n\n\n\nconst countModel = model('count').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 1,\n  },\n});\n\nexport default countModel;\n\n\nWe use the API model to create countModel, which currently only contains the\nstate that stores the counter value, that is, value in the code.\n\nWe define an action to increase the counter by 1:\n\n\n\nconst countModel = model('count').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 1,\n  },\n  actions: {\n    add(state) {\n      state.value += 1;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nexport default countModel;\n\n\nIn the add action, we can directly modify the value of the state and perform the\nincrement operation without treating the state as an immutable object. This is\nbecause Reduck integrates immer, which can directly modify the original state\nobject.\n\nNext, we will demonstrate how to use the Model in a component.\n\nCreate a new component called Counter, and use the countModel via the useModel\nAPI inside the component:\n\n\n\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [state, actions] = useModel(countModel);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \ncounter: {state.value}\n       actions.add()}>add\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nuseModel gets the state and actions of countModel. The component displays the\ncurrent value of the counter, and clicking the add button increments the counter\nby 1.\n\nINFO\nDue to the simplicity of the example used here, the layering of the MVC pattern\nis not strictly followed.

In this section, we will\nprovide additional information on other usage scenarios.\n\n\nDefining the State Type of the Model#\n\nDeclaring type information for the State of a Model is a best practice when\nusing Reduck in TypeScript.\n\ninterface State {\n  data: string;\n}\n\nexport const foo = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    data: '',\n  },\n  computed: {\n    withSuffix: state => state.data + 'suffix',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    setData: (state, payload: string) => {\n      state.data = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nWhen you declare type information for the State of a Model, the computed and\nactions of the Model can get the correct type information. In fact, even if we\ndon't define State type information in the example code above, the type\ninformation of State can be automatically inferred based on the initial value\ninformation of state. However, we still recommend that you declare the type\ninformation of State when defining a Model because the type information of State\ninferred based on the initial value information of state may be incomplete\n(missing fields or field type information), and the type information of State\ncannot be automatically inferred based on the initial value information of state\nwhen using Function Type to define the Model.\n\n\nDependent types of Derived State#\n\nWhen the derived state of a Model depends on other Models, you need to manually\nspecify the State of the other Models.\n\ninterface State {\n  data: string;\n}\n\nexport const bar = model('bar').define({\n  state: {\n    data: '',\n  },\n  computed: {\n    // specify the type for fooState\n    withFoo: [foo, (state, fooState: FooState) => state.data + fooState.data],\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nHooks for Getting Model Type Information#\n\nReduck provides a set of utility types for getting Model type information:\n\n * GetModelState: Get the type information of the State (including derived\n   state) of the Model.\n * GetModelActions: Get the type information of the Actions (including Effects\n   functions) of the Model.\n\nexport const foo = model('foo').define({\n  // skip some codes\n});\n\n// get the State type of foo\nlet fooActions: GetModelActions;\n// get the Actions type of foo\nlet fooState: GetModelState;\n","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":10,"title":"TS Best Practices"}},{"id":286,"title":"Use Models","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/model/use-model","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Using Models in Components","id":"using-models-in-components","depth":2,"charIndex":3},{"text":"Using as Global State","id":"using-as-global-state","depth":3,"charIndex":33},{"text":"Using as Static State","id":"using-as-static-state","depth":3,"charIndex":2191},{"text":"Using as Local State","id":"using-as-local-state","depth":3,"charIndex":4220},{"text":"Using outside of components","id":"using-outside-of-components","depth":2,"charIndex":5194}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\n\nUsing Models in Components#\n\n\nUsing as Global State#\n\nuseModel can be used to obtain the State, Actions, and other information of the\nModel. When the State of the Model is modified by Actions, any other components\nthat use the Model will automatically re-render.\n\nIn the counter example in Quick Start, we have demonstrated the use of useModel\nand will not repeat it here.\n\nuseModel supports passing multiple Models, and the State and Actions of multiple\nModels will be merged and returned as the result. For example:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 1,\n  },\n  actions: {\n    add(state) {\n      state += 1;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst barModel = model('bar').define({\n  state: {\n    title: 'bar',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    set(state, payload) {\n      state.title = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst [state, actions] = useModel([fooModel, barModel]);\n// 或\nconst [state, actions] = useModel(fooModel, barModel);\n\n\nstate and actions value are:\n\nstate = {\n  value: 1,\n  title: 'bar',\n};\n\nactions = {\n  add(state) {\n    state += 1;\n  },\n  set(state, payload) {\n    state.title = payload;\n  },\n};\n\n\nuseModel also supports selector operations on State and Actions to filter or\nrename State and Actions. For example:\n\nconst fooModel = model('foo').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 1,\n  },\n  actions: {\n    add(state) {\n      state += 1;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst barModel = model('bar').define({\n  state: {\n    value: 'bar',\n  },\n  actions: {\n    set(state, payload) {\n      state.value = payload;\n    },\n  },\n});\n\nconst [state, actions] = useModel(\n  [fooModel, barModel],\n  (fooState, barState) => ({\n    fooValue: fooState.value,\n    barValue: barState.value,\n  }), // stateSelector\n  (fooActions, barActions) => ({ add: fooActions.add }), // actionsSelector\n);\n\n\nWe use stateSelector to rename the states with the same name in fooModel and\nbarModel. We use actionsSelector to filter out the Actions of barModel.\n\nIf only actionsSelector needs to be set, you can set stateSelector to undefined\nas a placeholder. For example:\n\nconst [state, actions] = useModel(\n  [fooModel, barModel],\n  undefined,\n  (fooActions, barActions) => ({ add: fooActions.add }), // actionsSelector\n);\n\n\n\nUsing as Static State#\n\nuseStaticModel can be used to obtain the Model and use the state of the Model as\na static state. This ensures that the State accessed by the component is always\nthe latest value, but the change of the Model's State does not cause the current\ncomponent to re-render.\n\nINFO\nThe usage of useStaticModel is exactly the same as useModel.\n\nConsider the following scenario: there is an Input component responsible for\nuser input, and another Search component responsible for executing a search\noperation after the user input information is entered and the search button is\nclicked. We do not want the state changes during the user input process to cause\nSearch to re-render. In this case, useStaticModel can be used:\n\n\n\nfunction Search() {\n  // should not be destructured\n  const [state] = useStaticModel(searchModel);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n       {\n          const result = await mockSearch(state.input);\n          console.log(result);\n        }}\n      >\n        Search\n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nCaution\nDo not destructure the state returned by useStaticModel. For example, changing\nit to the following code: const [{input}] = useStaticModel(searchModel); will\nalways get the initial value of Input.\n\nuseStaticModel is also suitable for use with animation libraries such as\nreact-three-fiber, because binding fast-changing states in animation component\nUI can easily cause performance issues. In this case, you can choose to use\nuseStaticModel, which only subscribes to the State but does not cause the view\ncomponent to re-render. Here is a simplified example:\n\nfunction ThreeComponent() {\n  const [state, actions] = useStaticModel(modelA);\n\n  useFrame(() => {\n    state.value;\n    actions.setValue(1);\n    state.value;\n  });\n}\n\n\nUsing React's refs can also achieve similar effects. In fact, useStaticModel\nalso uses refs internally. However, using useStaticModel directly helps decouple\nthe state management logic from the component and converge it into the Model\nlayer.\n\nThe complete sample code can be found here.\n\n\nUsing as Local State#\n\nuseLocalModel can be used to obtain the Model and use the state of the Model as\nlocal state. At this time, the change of the Model State only causes the current\ncomponent to re-render, but does not cause other components that use the Model\nto re-render. The effect is similar to managing state through useState in React,\nbut it can decouple the state management logic from the component and converge\nit into the Model layer.\n\nINFO\nThe usage of useLocalModel is exactly the same as useModel.\n\nFor example, we modify the code of the counter application and add a counter\ncomponent LocalCounter with local state:\n\n\n\nfunction LocalCounter() {\n  const [state, actions] = useLocalModel(countModel);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \nlocal counter: {state.value}\n       actions.add()}>add\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nClick the add button of Counter and LocalCounter respectively, and the states of\nthe two do not affect each other:\n\n\n\nThe complete sample code can be found here.\n\n\nUsing outside of components#\n\nIn actual business scenarios, sometimes we need to use Model outside of React\ncomponents, such as accessing State and executing Actions in utility functions.\nAt this time, we need to use the Store. The Store is a low-level concept that\nusers generally cannot touch. It is responsible for storing and managing the\nentire application's state. Reduck's Store is based on Redux's Store\nimplementation and adds Reduck-specific APIs, such as use.\n\nFirst, call useStore in the component to obtain the store object used by the\ncurrent application and mount it to a variable outside the component:\n\nlet store; // Reference to `store` object outside of the component\nfunction setStore(s) {\n  store = s;\n}\nfunction getStore() {\n  return store;\n}\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [state] = useModel(countModel);\n  const store = useStore();\n  // Avoid unnecessary duplicate settings through `useMemo`\n  useMemo(() => {\n    setStore(store);\n  }, [store]);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \ncounter: {state.value}\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nYou can obtain the Model object through store.use, and the usage of store.use is\nthe same as useModel. Taking the counter application as an example, we perform\nan increment operation on the counter value every 1 second outside the component\ntree:\n\nsetInterval(() => {\n  const store = getStore();\n  const [, actions] = store.use(countModel);\n  actions.add();\n}, 1000);\n\n\nThe complete sample code can be found here.\n\nINFO\nIf the Store object is manually created through createStore, there is no need to\nobtain it through useStore in the component, and it can be used directly.\nAdditional Information\nFor detailed API definitions related to this section, please refer to here.","frontmatter":{"sidebar_position":3,"title":"Use Models"}},{"id":287,"title":"Using Reduck Separately","routePath":"/en/guides/topic-detail/model/use-out-of-modernjs","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nWhen integrating Reduck separately from Modern.js, the following modifications\nneed to be made:\n\n 1.

We execute the following command\nat the end point to create a new file:\n\nDelete the implementation in src/routes/page.tsx and change it to:\n\n\n\n\nThe content of src/components/Avatar/index.tsx is modified to:\n\n\n\nconst Avatar = styled.img`\n  width: 50px;\n  height: 50px;\n  border: 4px solid #0ef;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n`;\n\nexport default Avatar;\n\n\nExecute pnpm run dev, the result should be the same.\n\nnote\nThe reason for using the directory form Avatar/index.tsx instead of the\nsingle-file form Avatar.tsx is that you can easily add sub-files inside the\ndirectory later, including dedicated resources (pictures, etc.), dedicated\nsub-components, CSS files, etc.\n\n\nUtility#\n\nWe have used the style-components implementation component, but the current UI\nis still unsatisfactory and lacks professionalism, such as the list item inhouse\nlayout is a bit rough and misaligned in many places.\n\nNow, let's implement a better Item component ourselves, implementing a design\ndraft like this:\n\n\n\nThe UI to be implemented this time is more complex and has an internal\nstructure, but on the other hand, there is no very thick bright blue border of\nthe component such a very special UI, which is a very conventional horizontal\nand vertical layout, centering, font style, etc. In this case, there is actually\nno need to write CSS at all. There is a more efficient implementation method\nthat complements styled-components: Utility Class.\n\nModern.js integrates the mainstream, light, general-purpose Utility Class\nlibrary Tailwind CSS.\n\nExecute pnpm run new and select the following to start Tailwind CSS:\n\n? Action: Enable features\n? Enable features: Enable Tailwind CSS\n\n\nRegister the Tailwind plugin in modern.config.ts:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  runtime: {\n    router: true,\n    state: true,\n  },\n  server: {\n    ssr: true,\n  },\n  plugins: [appTools(), tailwindcssPlugin()],\n});\n\n\nImport the Tailwind CSS css file at the top of src/routes/page.tsx to start a\nquick implementation of the professional UI:\n\nimport 'tailwindcss/base.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/components.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/utilities.css';\n\n\nCreate the Item component first:\n\nModify src/routes/page.tsx to pass the render implementation of List to Item\ncomponent:\n\n\nimport 'tailwindcss/base.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/components.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/utilities.css';\n\n\nconst getAvatar = (users: Array<{ name: string, email: string }>) =>\n  users.map(user => ({\n    ...user,\n    avatar: `https://avatars.dicebear.com/v2/identicon/${user.name}.svg`,\n  }));\n\nconst mockData = getAvatar([\n  { name: 'Thomas', email: 'w.kccip@bllmfbgv.dm' },\n  { name: 'Chow', email: 'f.lfqljnlk@ywoefljhc.af' },\n  { name: 'Bradley', email: 'd.wfovsqyo@gpkcjwjgb.fr' },\n  { name: 'Davis', email: '\"t.kqkoj@utlkwnpwk.nu' },\n]);\n\nfunction Index() {\n  return (\n    \n\n       }\n      />\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Index;\n\n\nUtility Class(https://tailwindcss.com/docs/container) is used on the parent\ncontainer for a quick implementation of the most basic maximum width, center,\nand other styles.\n\nNext implementation src/components/Item/index.tsx:\n\n\n\ntype InfoProps = {\n  avatar: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  archived?: boolean;\n};\n\nconst Item = ({ info }: { info: InfoProps }) => {\n  const { avatar, name, email, archived } = info;\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n        \n\n          \n\n{name}\n          \n\n{email}\n        \n        \n          Archive\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nexport default Item;\n\n\nExecute pnpm run dev to see the expected running result:\n\n\n\nWe only use a few Utility Classes, such as Flex, Padding, Margin, Text, Font,\nBorder, without writing a single CSS implementation Professional UI that\nconforms to the design draft.\n\n\nCustomized Utility Class#\n\nWe can also implement the new Utility Class ourselves to facilitate reuse\nbetween codes.\n\nUtility Class itself is also a component-oriented technology (using different\nclasses on a component is equivalent to setting some attributes from the base\nclass for this component), but the classname of Utility Class is global (because\nit is used on arbitrary components/elements), it is very suitable for\nimplementation with separate CSS files.\n\nCreate a new CSS file:\n\nImport utils.css in src/routes/page.tsx:\n\nimport '../styles/utils.css';\n\n\nA Utility Class named custom-text-gray is implemented in\nsrc/routes/styles/utils.css.\n\n:root {\n  --custom-text-color: rgb(113, 128, 150);\n}\n\n.custom-text-gray {\n  color: var(--custom-text-color);\n}\n\n\nnote\nModern.js integrates with PostCSS and supports modern CSS syntax features such\nas custom properties.\n\nUse in src/routes/components/Item/index.tsx:\n\n\n\n\nChange to:\n\n\n\n\nExecute pnpm run dev, you can see that the font color has changed:\n\n\n\nnote\nThis is just to demonstrate Utility Class usage. In a real project, with\nTailwind CSS, this Utility Class is of little value and should be added to the\nfont color through the theme of the configuration Design System.\n\nutils.css can also be written as utils.scss or utils.less, Modern.js out of the\nbox support for SCSS and Less.\n\nHowever, with the support of PostCSS, modern CSS should be sufficient to meet\nthese development needs, and the performance is also better than that of the\npreprocessor. It is recommended to use .css files first.","frontmatter":{"title":"Add Style"}},{"id":294,"title":"Add Client Route","routePath":"/en/tutorials/first-app/c04-routes","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nIn the previous chapter, we learned how to create UI components and add styles.\n\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to add Client Route.\n\nPreviously we have added the Archive button to the point of contact list, next\nwe add a route /archives, when accessing this route, only the point of contact\nof the saved file is displayed, while the original / continues to display all\npoints of contact.\n\nCreate a new src/routes/archives/page.tsx file:\n\nAdd the following code:\n\nsrc/archives/page.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\nconst getAvatar = (users: Array<{ name: string; email: string }>) =>\n  users.map(user => ({\n    ...user,\n    avatar: `https://avatars.dicebear.com/v2/identicon/${user.name}.svg`,\n  }));\n\nconst getMockArchivedData = () =>\n  getAvatar([\n    { name: 'Thomas', email: 'w.kccip@bllmfbgv.dm' },\n    { name: 'Chow', email: 'f.lfqljnlk@ywoefljhc.af' },\n  ]);\nfunction Index() {\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n        Archives\n      \n       }\n      />\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Index;\n\n\nThe Helmet component of React Helmet is used here, and the Helmet component is\nalso added in src/routes/page.tsx:\n\n\n\nfunction Index() {\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n        All\n      \n      ...\n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nnote\nModern.js integrates react-helmet by default, and can also be used in\nconjunction with SSR to meet SEO needs.\n\nSince there are multiple pages now, all of which need to use the previous\nUtility Class, we need to move the style file to src/routes/layout.tsx:\n\nimport 'tailwindcss/base.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/components.css';\nimport 'tailwindcss/utilities.css';\nimport '../styles/utils.css';\n\n\nExecute pnpm run dev, visit http://localhost:8080, you can see the full point of\ncontact, the title of the page is All:\n\n\n\nVisit http://localhost:8080/archives and you will only see the point of contact\nof the saved file with the title Archives:\n\n\n\nLooking at the HTML source code of the page, you can see that the content of the\ntwo pages is the same, and different content is rendered for different URLs.\n\nNext we add a simple navigation bar that allows the user to toggle between the\ntwo lists.\n\nOpen src/routes/layout.tsx and import the Radio component at the top:\n\n\n\n\nThen modify the top of the UI to add a set of radio group:\n\nexport default function Layout() {\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n\n        \n          All\n          Archives\n        \n      \n      \n    \n  );\n}\n\n\nThen we come to the implementation of currentList and handleSetList.\n\nIntroducing three React Hooks: useState and useNavigate and useParams, as well\nas Ant Design's event type definition:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, add local state and related logic to the Layout component:\n\nexport default function Layout() {\n  const navigate = useNavigate();\n  const location = useLocation();\n  const [currentList, setList] = useState(location.pathname || '/');\n  const handleSetList = (e: RadioChangeEvent) => {\n    const { value } = e.target;\n    setList(value);\n    navigate(value);\n  };\n  return (\n  ...\n}\n\n\nAt this point, the page navigation bar implementation has been completed, and\nexecute pnpm run dev to see the effect:\n\n\n\nClick Archives in the navigation bar, you can see that the selected state and\nURL of the radio box will change, the page is not refreshed, only CSR occurs.\n\nAccessing the two pages through the URL, you can see that the HTML content is\ndifferent, because the page executes the logic of client routing in the SSR\nstage, and the HTML already contains the final render result.","frontmatter":{"title":"Add Client Route"}},{"id":295,"title":"Add Loader","routePath":"/en/tutorials/first-app/c05-loader","lang":"en","toc":[],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nIn the previous chapter, we learned how to add client route.\n\nIn this chapter, we will learn how to add Loader to the routing component.\n\nBy far, we have provided data to components through hardcoding. If you want to\nget data from the remote, you usually use useEffect to do it. But when SSR is\nenabled, useEffect will not be executed at the server level, so this SSR can\nonly render a very limited UI.\n\nModern.js provides the ability of Data Loader to support homogeneous data\nacquisition in components to maximize the value of SSR.\n\nBelow we demonstrate how to add Data Loader to the routing component and\nsimulate remote data acquisition.

If we continue to write in the component code, more and more\nnoodle code will be generated. To this end, we introduced a code module called\nModel to decoupling these business logic and UI.\n\nnote\nTo use the Model API, you need to opt in runtime.state:\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  runtime: {\n    state: true,\n  },\n});\n\n\n\nModel implementation#\n\nTo create a complete Model, you first need to define state, including the name\nand initial value of data in the state.\n\nWe use Model to manage the data of the point of contact list, so define the\nfollowing data state:\n\nconst state = {\n  items: [],\n};\n\n\nUsing TS syntax, you can define more complete type information, such as items in\neach object should have a name, email field. In order to implement archive\nfunction, also need to create the archived field to hold the point of contact\nhas been archived state.\n\nWe also need a field to access all archived points of contact. We can define a\nfield of type computed to convert the existing data:\n\nconst computed = {\n  archived: ({ items }) => {\n    return items.filter(item => item.archived);\n  },\n};\n\n\nFields of type computed are defined as function, but can be accessed through\nstate just like normal fields.\n\nINFO\nModern.js integrates Immer and can write such state transfer logic just like\nnormal mutable data in JS.\n\nWhen implementing the Archive button, we need an archive function, which is\nresponsible for modifying the archived field of the specified contact. We call\nthis function action:\n\nconst actions = {\n  archive(draft, payload) {\n    const target = draft.items.find(item => item.email === payload);\n    if (target) {\n      target.archived = true;\n    }\n  },\n};\n\n\nAn action function is a pure function, where a defined input gets a defined\noutput (a shifted state) and should not have any side effects.\n\nThe first parameter of the function is the Draft State provided by Immer, and\nthe second parameter is the parameter passed in when the action is called (more\non how to call it later).\n\nWe try to implement them completely:\n\nconst state = {\n  items: [],\n  pending: false,\n  error: null,\n};\n\nconst computed = {\n  archived: ({ items }) => {\n    return items.filter(item => item.archived);\n  },\n};\n\nconst actions = {\n  archive(draft, payload) {\n    const target = draft.items.find(item => item.email === payload);\n    if (target) {\n      target.archived = true;\n    }\n  },\n};\n\n\nNext we connect the above code and put it in the same Model file. First execute\nthe following command to create a new file directory:\n\nmkdir -p src/models/\ntouch src/models/contacts.ts\n\n\nAdd src/models/contacts.ts:\n\n\n\ntype State = {\n  items: {\n    avatar: string;\n    name: string;\n    email: string;\n    archived?: boolean;\n  }[];\n  pending: boolean;\n  error: null | Error;\n};\n\nexport default model('contacts').define({\n  state: {\n    items: [],\n    pending: false,\n    error: null,\n  },\n  computed: {\n    archived: ({ items }: State) => items.filter(item => item.archived),\n  },\n  actions: {\n    archive(draft, payload) {\n      const target = draft.items.find(item => item.email === payload)!;\n      if (target) {\n        target.archived = true;\n      }\n    },\n  },\n});\n\n\nWe call a plain object containing elements such as state, action, etc. as Model\nSpec, Modern.js provides Model API, which can generate Model from Model Spec.\n\n\nUse Model#\n\nNow let's use this Model directly to complement the logic of the project.\n\nFirst modify src/components/Item/index.tsx and add the UI and interaction of the\nArchive button, the content is as follows:\n\n\n\ntype InfoProps = {\n  avatar: string;\n  name: string;\n  email: string;\n  archived?: boolean;\n};\n\nconst Item = ({\n  info,\n  onArchive,\n}: {\n  info: InfoProps;\n  onArchive?: () => void;\n}) => {\n  const { avatar, name, email, archived } = info;\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n      \n\n        \n\n          \n\n{name}\n          \n\n{email}\n        \n        \n          {archived ? 'Archived' : 'Archive'}\n        \n      \n    \n  );\n};\n\nexport default Item;\n\n\nNext, we add src/routes.page.loader and modify src/routes/page.tsx to pass more\nparameters to the component:\n\nsrc/routes/page.loader.ts\n\nexport type LoaderData = {\n  code: number;\n  data: {\n    name: string;\n    avatar: string;\n    email: string;\n  }[];\n};\n\nexport default async (): Promise => {\n  const data = new Array(20).fill(0).map(() => {\n    const firstName = name.firstName();\n    return {\n      name: firstName,\n      avatar: `https://avatars.dicebear.com/api/identicon/${firstName}.svg`,\n      email: internet.email(),\n      archived: false,\n    };\n  });\n\n  return {\n    code: 200,\n    data,\n  };\n};\n\n\nsrc/routes/page.tsx\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction Index() {\n  const { data } = useLoaderData() as LoaderData;\n  const [{ items }, { archive, setItems }] = useModel(contacts);\n  if (items.length === 0) {\n    setItems(data);\n  }\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n        All\n      \n       (\n           {\n              archive(info.email);\n            }}\n          />\n        )}\n      />\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Index;\n\n\nuseModel is the hooks API provided by the Modern.js. You can provide the state\ndefined in the Model in the component, or call the side effects and actions\ndefined in the Model through actions to change the state of the Model.\n\nModel is business logic, a computational process that does not create or hold\nstate itself. Only after being used by the component with the hooks API, the\nstate is created in the specified place.\n\nExecute pnpm run dev and click the Archive button to see that the page UI has\nchanged.\n\nNOTE\nIn the above example, useLoaderData is actually executed every time the route is\nswitched. Because we used fake data in the Data Loader, the data returned each\ntime is different. But we use the data in the Model first, so the data does not\nchange when switching routes.","frontmatter":{"title":"Add Model"}},{"id":297,"title":"Add Container","routePath":"/en/tutorials/first-app/c07-container","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"Use the full Model","id":"use-the-full-model","depth":2,"charIndex":549},{"text":"Withdraw container components","id":"withdraw-container-components","depth":2,"charIndex":2943}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nIn the previous chapter, we initially introduced the model to split this part of\nthe logic from the UI component.

The former is\nresponsible for UI display, interaction, etc., and the latter is responsible for\nthe implementation of UI-independent business logic, which specializes in\nmanaging state.\n\nLike src/routes/page.tsx and src/routes/archives/page.tsx use the component of\nthe useModel API, which is responsible for linking the two layers of View and\nModel, similar to the role of the Controller in the traditional MVC\narchitecture. In the Modern.js, we follow the habit and call them Container.\n\nThe container component is recommended to be placed in a special containers/\ndirectory. We execute the following command to create a new file:\n\nWe extracted the common part of the original two page.tsx, and the code of\nsrc/containers/Contacts.tsx is as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nfunction Contacts({\n  title,\n  source,\n}: {\n  title: string;\n  source: 'items' | 'archived';\n}) {\n  const [state, { archive }] = useModel(contacts);\n\n  return (\n    \n\n      \n        {title}\n      \n       (\n           {\n              archive(info.email);\n            }}\n          />\n        )}\n      />\n    \n  );\n}\n\nexport default Contacts;\n\n\nModify the code for src/routes/page.tsx and src/routes/archives/page.tsx:\n\nsrc/routes/page.tsx\n\n\n\nfunction Index() {\n  return ;\n}\n\nexport default Index;\n\n\nsrc/routes/archives/page.tsx\n\n\n\nfunction Index() {\n  return ;\n}\n\nexport default Index;\n\n\nThe refactoring is complete, and the current project structure is:\n\n.\n├── README.md\n├── dist\n├── modern.config.ts\n├── node_modules\n├── package.json\n├── pnpm-lock.yaml\n├── src\n│   ├── components\n│   │   ├── Avatar\n│   │   │   └── index.tsx\n│   │   └── Item\n│   │       └── index.tsx\n│   ├── containers\n│   │   └── Contacts.tsx\n│   ├── models\n│   │   └── contacts.ts\n│   ├── modern-app-env.d.ts\n│   ├── routes\n│   │   ├── archives\n│   │   │   └── page.tsx\n│   │   ├── layout.tsx\n│   │   └── page.tsx\n│   └── styles\n│       └── utils.css\n└── tsconfig.json\n\n\nThe view components in components/ dir are in the form of directories, such as\nAvatar/index.tsx.

This is a best practice we\nrecommend.\n\nAs mentioned in the chapter Add UI component, the view component is in the form\nof a directory, because the view component is responsible for the implementation\nof UI display and interaction details, and can evolve in complexity. In the form\nof a directory, it is convenient to add sub-files, including dedicated resources\n(pictures, etc.), dedicated sub-components, CSS files, etc. You can reconstruct\nat will within this directory, considering only the smallest parts.\n\nThe container component is only responsible for linkage and is a glue layer. The\nsophisticated business logic and implementation details are handed over to the\nView layer and the Model layer for implementation. The container component\nitself should be kept simple and clear, and should not contain complex\nimplementation details, so there should be no internal structure. The\nsingle-file form is not only more concise, but also acts as a constraint,\nreminding developers not to write complicated container components.","frontmatter":{"title":"Add Container"}},{"id":298,"title":"Add Application Entry","routePath":"/en/tutorials/first-app/c08-entries","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"New entry","id":"new-entry","depth":2,"charIndex":273},{"text":"Modify the configuration by entry","id":"modify-the-configuration-by-entry","depth":2,"charIndex":2999},{"text":"Next step","id":"next-step","depth":2,"charIndex":4199}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nIn the last chapter, we basically completed the development of the point of\ncontact list application, introduced the usage of some functions in the\nModern.js, and recommended best practices.\n\nIn this chapter, we will describe how to add a new entry to the application.\n\n\nNew entry#\n\nA complete project may require multiple entries, Modern.js supports the\nautomatic creation of new entries, as mentioned in the previous section, pnpm\nrun new can enable optional features.\n\nWe can also use it to create new project elements and execute pnpm run new in\nthe project root directory:\n\n? Action Create project element\n? Create project element New \"entry\"\n? Entry name (entry) landing-page\n\n\nWhen created, the project will look like this:\n\n.\n├── README.md\n├── modern.config.ts\n├── node_modules\n├── package.json\n├── pnpm-lock.yaml\n├── src\n│   ├── modern-app-env.d.ts\n│   ├── landing-page\n│   │   └── routes\n│   │       ├── index.css\n│   │       ├── layout.tsx\n│   │       └── page.tsx\n│   └── myapp\n│       ├── components\n│       │   ├── Avatar\n│       │   │   └── index.tsx\n│       │   └── Item\n│       │       └── index.tsx\n│       ├── containers\n│       │   └── Contacts.tsx\n│       ├── models\n│       │   └── contacts.ts\n│       ├── routes\n│       │   ├── archives\n│       │   │   └── page.tsx\n│       │   ├── layout.tsx\n│       │   └── page.tsx\n│       └── styles\n│           └── utils.css\n└── tsconfig.json\n\n\nYou can see that the files of the contact list application are automatically\nrefactored into src/myapp/.\n\nAt the same time, a new src/landing-page/ is created, which also has routes/*\n(the pnpm run new command only does these things, so you can also easily create\nnew entries or modify entries manually).\n\nExecute pnpm run dev to display:\n\n\n\nAccess http://localhost:8080/ to see the application as before.\n\nVisit http://localhost:8080/landing-page to see the landing-page for the new\nentry you just created (Modern.js automatically generated default page).\n\nOne of the design principles of the Modern.js framework is [Convention over\nConfiguration ]. In most cases, you can write code directly by convention\nwithout any configuration. The directory structure in src/ is a convention:\n\nsrc/myapp/ and src/landing-page/ are automatically identified as two application\nportals: myapp and landing-page.\n\nThe directory name of src/myapp/ is the same as the project name (name in\npackage.json), which will be considered as the main entry of the project, and\nthe root path of the project URL (the default in the development environment is\nhttp://localhost:8080/) will automatically point to the main entry.\n\nThe URL of other entries is to append the entry name after the root path, such\nas http://localhost:8080/landing-page.\n\nNext, we rename src/myapp/ to src/contacts/:\n\nmv src/myapp src/contacts\n\n\nExecute pnpm run dev again, the result becomes:\n\n\n\nThere is no longer a main entry, the point of contact list is now a normal entry\nthat needs to be accessed with http://localhost:8080/contacts.\n\n\nModify the configuration by entry#\n\nIn the Modern.js configuration file, we can write our own code to control the\nconfiguration of the project.\n\nNow, modify the modern.config.ts to add something:\n\nmodern.config.ts\n\n\n\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  runtime: {\n    router: true,\n    state: true,\n  },\n  server: {\n    ssr: true,\n    ssrByEntries: {\n      'landing-page': false,\n    },\n  },\n  plugins: [appTools(), tailwindcssPlugin()],\n});\n\n\nExecute pnpm run dev, and then open view-source:\nhttp://localhost:8080/landing-page with the browser, you can see that the\ncontent of the landing-page web page is dynamically loaded through js, and the\nSSR function of this page is turned off.\n\nIf ssrByEntries and its value are annotated, the SSR function of landing-page is\nrestored.\n\nOther times, you need some more sophisticated logic to do the setup, such as JS\nvariables, expressions, import modules, etc., for example, only in the\ndevelopment environment to enable SSR:\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  server: {\n    ssrByEntries: {\n      'landing-page': process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',\n    },\n  },\n};\n\n\nSo far, the prototype of our point of contact list application is almost\ncomplete 👏👏👏.\n\n\nNext step#\n\nThen you can further refine your application by following more tutorials like\nGuides, configuration, and more.","frontmatter":{"title":"Add Application Entry"}},{"id":299,"title":"Introduction","routePath":"/en/tutorials/foundations/introduction","lang":"en","toc":[{"text":"What is Modern.js?","id":"what-is-modern.js?","depth":2,"charIndex":169},{"text":"Tutorial","id":"tutorial","depth":2,"charIndex":271}],"domain":"","content":"#\n\nWelcome to Modern.js tutorials!\n\nAfter reading this section, you will have an initial understanding of Modern.js\nand use Modern.js to create your first application.\n\n\nWhat is Modern.js?#\n\nIf you don't know Modern.js yet, please can read Modern.js Introduction first.\n\n\nTutorial#\n\nWe have prepared a tutorial on creating a \"contact list app\" that you can follow\nstep by step to create an app and learn about the following practices in\nModern.js:\n\n * Creating a project\n * Using the antd component library\n * Integrating Tailwind CSS\n * Client-side routing\n * Data fetching\n * State Management\n * Container components\n * New portal\n * ...","frontmatter":{"title":"Introduction","sidebar_position":1}}]
