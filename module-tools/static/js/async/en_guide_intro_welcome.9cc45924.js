It allows developers to build, debug, and publish module type project more easily. A module type project can mostly be thought of as an npm package type project, which may be a component, component library or tool library project.\\n\\nIf you are planning to develop a project of the npm package type, then you came to the right place! Modern.js provides a professional module engineering solution. It gives you:\\n\\n- **Simple project initialization**: simply execute the `npx @modern-js/create project-dir` command, followed by a few interactive questions, to create a complete module type project. The created project also supports the choice of two package managers, [**pnpm**](https://pnpm.io/) and [**Yarn**](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/).\\n- **Code formatting**: In a module project, you can execute `modern lint` to format the code. The initialized module project includes the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/user-guide/core-concepts#what-is-eslint) ruleset for Modern.js for most scenarios.\\n- **Comprehensive build capabilities and faster builds**: Module Tools provides high-performance build capabilities based on [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/getting-started/) and [SWC](https://swc.rs/), and provides rich configurations for different build scenarios.\\n- **Storybook debugging tools**: Module Tools provides [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) debugging tools for debugging module projects. After installing the Storybook plugin for Module Tools, you can start it with the `modern dev storybook` command. You can use Storybook not only for debugging components, but also for other types of modules.\\n- **Testing capabilities with Jest**: When you need to test a module, you can use the `modern test` command of Module Tools, which not only integrates with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), but also provides an API for configuring [Jest](https://jestjs.io/docs/configuration).\\n- **Versioning based on Changesets**: When you need to record changes to a project, you can use the `modern change` command to generate a Markdown file containing the changes; when you need to upgrade a project, you can use the `modern bump` command to analyze and upgrade the version through the Markdown file; when you need to release a project, you can use the `modern release` command to release the project; Module Tools implements these commands based on [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets).\\n- **Extensible plug-in mechanism**: Want to integrate additional debugging tools for your project? Or maybe you want to do some extra processing during the build process, Module Tools provides a plugin mechanism and plugin hooks that cover both the `dev` command and the `build` command process. You can use them to extend the capabilities of your project.\\n- **Lots more!** Module Tools will continue to optimize its build and debug features in the future. If there are important issues to be solved in module project building, or if a mainstream module project debugging tool or pattern emerges, then they will probably be supported by Module Tools.\\n"';function a(e){const o=Object.assign({h1:"h1",a:"a",p:"p",ul:"ul",li:"li",strong:"strong",code:"code"},e.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsxs)(o.h1,{id:"welcome-to-module-tools",children:[(0,n.jsx)(o.a,{className:"header-anchor","aria-hidden":"true",href:"#welcome-to-module-tools",children:"#"}),"Welcome to Module Tools"]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(o.p,{children:"Module Tools is a modules engineering solution for Modern.js, as well as a core dependency.
